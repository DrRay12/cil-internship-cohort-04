# _Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development._

## Scrum
Scrum is a widely used subset of Agile methodology; it is a software development strategy that aims at efficiently deploying software products through a series of short sprints [usually 2-4 weeks]. Instead of working in a large group, trying to create a large product, scrum makes use of a small team, spending a short time building small features at a time that is eventually integrated as a whole in a short time. It creates an efficient and fast software development process by optimizing an iterative process, early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early, reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreading testing throughout the development process.

This methodology splits the organization into small, cross-functional, and self-organizing teams to work on product features [back logs] as provided by the product owner. The scrum team being guided by a scrum master takes the backlog with the highest priority and plans to implement it, the backlog is developed in a sprint [2-4 weeks length] in which the team members focus on the goal, testing and implementing market-ready product features. This goes on until the software development is complete. Some of the main benefits of the scrum software development process includes-

- **Lower risk in the development process**

Small Increments of the working product are made visible to the Product Owner and stakeholders at regular intervals. This helps the Scrum Team to identify risks early making it easier to respond to them. The transparency in Scrum helps to ensure that any necessary decisions can be taken at an earlier time, while it can still make a difference to the outcome. Risks are owned by the Scrum Team and are regularly reviewed making the risk of a failed initiative reduced.

- **Flexibility of software development process**

In traditional product development, there are big specifications created upfront and then business owners are told how expensive it is to change anything, particularly as the project proceeds. Changes are resisted in this method and a change control process is used to keep change to a minimum. This approach often fails as it assumes we can know what we want with 100% clarity at the start of development (which is usually not the case) and that no changes will be required that could make the product more valuable. In agile development, change is accepted and expected. Often the time scale is fixed and detailed requirements emerge and evolve as the product is developed. 

- **Business Engagement/Customer Satisfaction**

The active involvement of a Product Owner, the high transparency of the product and progress, and the flexibility to change when it is needed creates much better business engagement and leads to greater customer satisfaction. This is an important benefit that can create more positive and enduring working and customer relationships.

- **Valuable product development**

The ability for requirements to emerge and evolve and the ability to embrace change helps ensure the Scrum Team builds the right product which delivers the anticipated value to the user. In agile development, the emphasis is placed on building the right product that will deliver the desired value and benefits.

- **Speed To Market**

Research suggests about 80% of all market leaders were first to market. As well as the higher revenue from incremental delivery, agile development supports the practice of early and regular releases.

- **More Enjoyable**

The active involvement, cooperation and collaboration in successful Scrum Teams makes for a more enjoyable place to work. When people enjoy what they do, the quality of their work will be higher and the possibility for innovation will be greater. Happy and motivated people are more efficient, effective and more likely to stick around.
