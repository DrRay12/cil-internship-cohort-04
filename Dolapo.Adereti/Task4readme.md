_Here are some interesting facts about me and my career journey:_
 
- I started out learning HTML with notepad in 2016 but I dropped it because it was stressful but I enjoyed creating the structure and styling with it
- I rediscovered my interest about a year ago, this time in designing as it helped me explore my creative side
- I now enjoy crafting user experience and user interfaces that make processes easier for users and improve business-customer retention
- Being in this internship is super exciting for me because I have learned a whole lot in the shortest time.


## My design journey 
For my past year of continuous learning and self-development, I have been able to improve my skills in UI design, UX design, UX research, HTML/CSS Web development, and Webflow development. I honestly enjoy learning new concepts and improving myself by the day. Being in this internship has made me achieve that with the opportunity to learn about various departments in the IT Industry. Excited for what is to come!
