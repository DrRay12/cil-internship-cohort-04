1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in 
software development.

**Scrum** is a subset of agile software development and a framework that is most frequently used by software development teams to work together. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

**How Scrum Works**

It is used by teams to develop, deliver and sustain complex products. scrum is about continuously shipping of products to customers and it can also be regarded as a framework for getting work done.
With scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints, they break down big complex projects into small bit size pieces, it makes projects more manageable and allows teams to share high quality work faster and more frequently and gives them more flexibility to adapt in change.


For example, when a development team set out to develop a new product or improve on the existing ones, they will have a long list of features, requirements and fixes to work on which are called "Product backlog or could be seen as a "TO-Do" list. 
They come together to address or discuss these complex problems.

Scrum revolves round short iteratively release cycles or 'sprints' that allows a team to ship often, re-prioritize when needed and constantly improve.
Sprint: A short time period when a potentially shippable incremented work is created or simply put a period where software development is done.
This typically runs between two weeks, but the team can decide which works for them. During this period, the team participate in several events called 'ceremonies'.

The key ceremonies are:

1. Sprint planning:

This is the time/meeting where the work from the 'Product backlog' to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned by the entire development team. The meeting is usually led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal.
At the end of the planning, every member of the team is clear about what can be delivered.

2. Daily scrum standup meetings:

This is a daily short meeting that happens at the same time (usually mornings) and place to keep it simple. Usually, the meeting takes around 15 minutes. This meeting is also called a ‘daily stand-up’ emphasizing that it needs to be a quick one. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.

3. Sprint Reviews:

This is the time at the end of the sprint where the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment (work done). The development team showcases the backlog items that are now ‘Done’ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner here can now decide whether to release the increment, although in most cases the increment is released.

4. Sprint retrospectives:

The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.

**Benefits of Scrum**

With the short iterations,
* It helps to embrace changes by the software development team
* It reduces risk and costs
* it helps to get fast feedback from users
* Increased speed to market and see value quicker
