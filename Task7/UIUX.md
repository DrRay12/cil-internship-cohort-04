INTRODUCTION TO UI/UX
Creation of great digital products did not just happen, there was a process. The
process itself is a product, and what brings about the success of this product is
understanding of Good UI and Good UX, Also the bad side of the two because it's only
when you understand the good side and bad side of something that you are able to
differentiate between the two. A good UX must have some qualities which are: usability,
usefulness, enjoyability, and equitability. When products have the otherwise of these
qualities then it definitely has a bad UX. This brings us to the question of what is UX?,
what is UI? UX Design which is user experience design is how a user feels about a
design. while a UI design is the visual aspect of design. When a product has the two
and accessibility is considered the product will definitely standouts among its
competitors.
It is essential for us to understand what fields are under the UI(User interface) and for
the UX(user experience). A user interface designer works on the aesthetics part of a
product, sort of color, fonts, interactions, and prototyping while also considering
accessibility and equitability. On the other hand, a UX designer works on the user
journey map(which is the user journey before and after using our product), the user
journey map is always carved out of our empathy maps, they also do user
persona(which is the few people representing a large group of users), they conduct
usability testing too, all these to be able to give users the best experience. Don norman
who is one of the pioneer of UX design talked about emotional design which is the
emotions that evoke from the use of a product by users could be visceral, behavioral
and reflective. For example, someone who uses android wants to try out an iphone, the
excitement he feels when he is about to use it or get it is the visceral part, the emotions
he feels probably is not that good with the Iphone is the behavioral part of emotional
design while the reflective part is the user going back to use his normal android
because it gives him good experience.
The basics and what we should understand in all of these is making our products a
human centered products(making the user a priority), and for we to do these mastery of
UI and UX is essential
