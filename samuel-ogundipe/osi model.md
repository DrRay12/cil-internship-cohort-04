Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model
Answer: Tcp/Ip Model
Tcp/Ip Model
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. TCP/IP Stack is 
specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an 
unreliable internetwork
TCP/IP Model helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the 
internet and how data should be transmitted between them. It helps you to create a virtual 
network when multiple computer networks are connected together. The purpose of TCP/IP 
model is to allow communication over large distances
Features
 Support for a flexible TCP/IP architecture
 Adding more system to a network is easy.
 In TCP IP protocols suite, the network remains intact until the source, and 
destination machines were functioning properly.
 TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.
 TCP offers reliability and ensures that data which arrives out of sequence should put 
back into order.
 TCP allows you to implement flow control, so sender never overpowers a receiver 
with data.
TCP/IP is a layered server architecture system in which each layer is defined according to a 
specific function to perform. All these four TCP IP layers work collaboratively to transmit the 
data from one layer to another.
Application Layer
Transport Layer
Internet Layer
Network Interface
Application Layer: The application layer is the group of applications that let the user 
access the network. For most of us that means email, messaging apps, and cloud storage 
programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving 
data.
 Application-layer helps you to identify communication partners, determining 
resource availability, and synchronizing communication.
 It allows users to log on to a remote host
 This layer provides various e-mail services
 This application offers distributed database sources and access for global 
information about various objects and services.
Transport Layer: The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two 
communicating devices. It’s like sending an insured package: The transport layer divides the 
data in packets, acknowledges the packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that 
the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.
 It divides the message received from the session layer into segments and numbers 
them to make a sequence.
 Transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process on 
the destination machine.
 It also makes sure that the entire message arrives without any error else it should be 
retransmitted.
Internet Layer: The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and 
routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. This layer is also responsible 
for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the 
internet layer may take a little longer to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an 
error corrupting that file.
This layer parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are 
responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols 
residing at this layer are:
 IP – stands for Internet Protocol and it is responsible for delivering packets from the 
source host to the destination host by looking at the IP addresses in the packet 
headers. IP has 2 versions:
IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the one that most of the websites are using currently. But IPv6 
is growing as the number of IPv4 addresses are limited in number when compared to 
the number of users.
 ICMP – stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is encapsulated within IP 
datagrams and is responsible for providing hosts with information about network 
problems.
 ARP – stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Its job is to find the hardware address 
of a host from a known IP address. ARP has several types: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, 
Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP.
The Network Interface Layer: Network Interface Layer is this layer of the four-layer 
TCP/IP model. This layer is also called a network access layer. It helps you to define details 
of how data should be sent using the network.
It also includes how bits should optically be signalled by hardware devices which directly 
interfaces with a network medium, like coaxial, optical, coaxial, fibre, or twisted-pair cables.
A network layer is a combination of the data line and defined in the article of OSI reference 
model. This layer defines how the data should be sent physically through the network. This 
layer is responsible for the transmission of the data between two devices on the same 
network.
Advantages of the TCP/IP model
1. It helps you to establish/set up a connection between different types of computers.
2. It operates independently of the operating system.
3. It supports many routing-protocols.
4. It enables the internetworking between the organizations.
5. TCP/IP model has a highly scalable client-server architecture.
6. It can be operated independently.
7. Supports a number of routing protocols.
8. It can be used to establish a connection between two computers.
Disadvantages of the TCP/IP model
1. TCP/IP is a complicated model to set up and manage.
2. The shallow/overhead of TCP/IP is higher-than IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange).
3. In this, model the transport layer does not guarantee delivery of packets.
4. Replacing protocol in TCP/IP is not easy.
5. It has no clear separation from its services, interfaces, and protocols.
Similarities between the TCP/IP model and the OSI model
 Both are logical models.
 Both define standards for networking.
 Both provide a framework for creating and implementing networking standards and 
devices. Both divide the network communication process into layers.
 In both models, a single layer defines a particular functionality and sets standards for 
that functionality only.
 Both models allow a manufacturer to make devices and network components that 
can coexist and work with the devices and components made by other 
manufacturers.
 Both models simplify the troubleshooting process by dividing complex functions into 
simpler components.
 Instead of defining the already defined standards and protocols, both models 
referenced them. For example, the Ethernet standards were already defined by IEEE 
before the creation of these models. So instead of defining them again both models 
used them as IEEE Ethernet standards. 
Differences between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model
 The OSI Layer model has seven layers while the TCP/IP model has four layers.
 The OSI Layer model is no longer used while the TCP/IP is still used in computer 
networking.
 To define the functionalities of upper layers, the OSI model uses three separate 
layers (Application, Presentation, and Session) while the TCP/IP model uses a single 
layer (Application).
 Just like the upper layers, the OSI model uses two separate layers (Physical and Datalink) to define the functionalities of the bottom layers while the TCP/IP uses a single 
layer (Link layer) for the same.
 To define the routing protocols and standards, the OSI model uses the Network layer 
while the TCP/IP model uses the Internet layer. 
 The OSI model is well documented than the TCP/IP model.
 The OSI model explains every standard and protocol in detail while the TCP/IP model 
provides a summarized version of the same

 TCP supports flexible architecture
 Application layer interacts with an application program, which is the highest level of 
OSI model.
 Internet layer is a second layer of the TCP/IP model. It is also known as a network

 An Internet Protocol address that is also known as an IP address is a numerical label.
 HTTP is a foundation of the World Wide Web.
 SMTP stands for Simple mail transfer protocol which supports the e-mail is known as 
a simple mail transfer
 SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol.
 DNS stands for Domain Name System.
 TELNET stands for Terminal Network. It establishes the connection between the local
