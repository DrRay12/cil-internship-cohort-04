What Is Scrum
Scrum is a process framework used to manage product development. Scrum is usually said 
to be empirical meaning that it provides a means for teams to establish a hypothesis of how 
they envision something should work, try it out, reflect on the experience, and make the 
appropriate adjustments. That is, when the framework is used properly. Scrum is structured 
in a way that allows teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks where they 
make sense for the team’s context.
When is Scrum Applicable?
Scrum is best suited in the case where a cross-functional team is working in a product 
development setting where there is a non-trivial amount of work that allows for splitting
into more than one 2 – 4 week iterations.
Scrum Practices
Sprint
The Sprint has a time-frame of 2-4 weeks during which the team produces a potential
product that can be launched.
Typical characteristics of Sprints:
 Maintain a consistent duration throughout a development effort
 A new Sprint immediately follows the conclusion of the previous Sprint
 Start date and end date of Sprint are fixed
Sprint Planning
A team starts out a Sprint with a discussion to determine which items from the product 
backlog they will work on during the Sprint. The end result of Sprint Planning is the Sprint 
Backlog.
Sprint Planning typically occurs in two parts. In the first part, the product owner and the rest 
of the team agree on which product backlog items will be included in the Sprint.
In the Second Part of Sprint Planning, the team determines how they will successfully deliver 
the identified product backlog items as part of the potentially shippable product increment. 
The team may identify specific tasks necessary to make that happen if that is one of their 
practices. The product backlog items identified for delivery and tasks if applicable make up 
the Sprint Backlog.
Once the team and product owner establish the scope of the Sprint as described by the 
product backlog items no more items can be added to the Sprint Backlog. This protects the 
team from scope changes within that Sprint.
Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a short (usually limited to 15 minutes) discussion where the team 
coordinates their activities for the following day. The Daily Scrum is not intended to be a 
status reporting meeting or a problem-solving discussion.
Sprint Review
At the end of the Sprint, the entire team (including the product owner) reviews the results 
of the sprint with stakeholders of the product. The purpose of this discussion is to discuss, 
demonstrate, and potentially give the stakeholders a chance to use, the increment in order 
to get feedback. The Sprint Review is not intended to provide a status report. Feedback 
from the sprint review gets placed into the Product Backlog for future consideration.
Sprint Retrospective
At the end of the Sprint following the sprint review, the team (including the product owner) 
should reflect upon how things went during the previous sprint and identify adjustments 
they could make going forward. The result of this retrospective is at least one action item 
included on the following Sprint’s Sprint-Backlog.
Artifacts
Product Backlog
The product backlog is an ordered list of all the possible changes that could be made to the 
product. Items on the product backlog are options, not commitments in that just because 
they exist on the Product Backlog does not guarantee they will be delivered.
The Product Owner maintains the product backlog on an ongoing basis including its content, 
availability, and ordering.
Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the collection of product backlog items selected for delivery in the 
Sprint, and if the team identifies tasks, the tasks necessary to deliver those product backlog 
items and achieve the Sprint Goal.
Increment
The increment is the collection of the Product Backlog Items that meet the team’s Definition 
of Done by the end of the Sprint. The Product Owner may decide to release the increment 
or build upon it in future Sprints.
Definition of Done
The definition of done is a team’s shared agreement on the criteria that a Product Backlog 
Item must meet before it is considered done.
Roles
The Product Owner
The product owner is a role team responsible for managing the product backlog in order to 
achieve the desired outcome that the team seeks to accomplish.
The product owner role exists in Scrum to address challenges that product development 
teams had with multiple, conflicting direction or no direction at all with respect to what to 
build.
The Scrum Master
The scrum master is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and 
principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.
The name was initially intended to indicate someone who is an expert at Scrum and can 
therefore coach others.
The role does not generally have any actual authority. People filling this role have to lead 
from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.
The Development Team
The development team consists of the people who deliver the product increment inside a 
Sprint.
The main responsibility of the development team is to deliver the increment that delivers 
value to every Sprint. How the work is divided is left up to the team to determine based on 
the conditions at that time.
Lifecycle
Scrum is a framework that allows development teams the flexibility to respond to changing 
situations. This framework has sufficient control points in place to ensure the team does not 
stray from the desired outcome, and that issues can be identified and resolved and process 
adjustments made while the effort is still underway.
The Scrum Lifecycle starts with a prioritized backlog but does not provide any guidance as to 
how that backlog is developed or prioritized.
The Scrum Lifecycle consists of a series of Sprints, where the end result is a potentially 
shippable product increment. Inside of these sprints, all of the activities necessary for the 
development of the product occur on a small subset of the overall product. Below is a 
description of the key steps in the Scrum Lifecycle:
Establish the Product Backlog.
The product owner and development team conduct Sprint Planning. Determine the scope of 
the Sprint in the first part of Sprint Planning and the plan for delivering that scope in the 
second half of Sprint Planning.
As the Sprint progresses, the development team performs the work necessary to deliver the 
selected product backlog items.
On a daily basis, the development team coordinates their work in a Daily Scrum.
At the end of the Sprint, the development team delivers the Product Backlog Items selected 
during Sprint Planning. The development team holds a Sprint Review to show the customer 
the increment and get feedback. The development team and product owner also reflect on 
how the Sprint has proceeded so far and adapting their processes accordingly during a 
retrospective.
The Team repeats steps 2–5 until the desired outcome of the product have been met.
