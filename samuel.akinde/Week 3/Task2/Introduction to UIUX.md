# Case Study on GTB App
UX
-	Usability: There are no quick links to make it easier for a user to perform primary actions once they get on the dashboard.
-	Useful: The search option is hard to spot and looks more like a button that an input field.
-	Accessibility: All primary action buttons are on the drop down menu
-	Desirability: Visually, the interface looks messy and confusing, starting from the use of colors down to hierarchy of information, it’s too busy for the eyes.

### Introduction
UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. They’re usually placed together in a single term and viewed from the surface they seem to be describing the same thing. It’s often hard to find solid descriptions of the two that don’t descend too far into jargon. 
The truth is, UX and UI are two sides of the same coin.
Think of it this way: UX is all about how a product feels. UI is all about how a product looks.
UI design refers to user interface design, while UX design stands for user experience design.UI is how something looks and how you interact with it. UX is how something works.


### What is User Interface (UI) Design?
UI design is the process of creating software or digital device interfaces with an emphasis on aesthetics or style. Designers strive to produce appealing, user-friendly designs.
Making user interactions as easy and effective as feasible is the aim of user interface design.

A well-designed user interface makes it easier to complete the task at hand without calling attention to itself. By affecting how the user interacts with the interface and enhancing the design's visual appeal, graphic design and typography are used to promote usability. Design aesthetics may either improve or impair users' ability to use the interface's features.

### Why is the user interface design important? 
User interface design is crucial since it has the power to increase or decrease your clientele. It may mean the difference between an app or website succeeding or failing. It may also determine whether visitors to your website remain or leave.

### What is UX design?
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.
UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience design encompasses traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.

### Why is User Experience Design important? 
n the case of a website, UX design includes everything from aesthetics to whether or not a site is usable, and it plays a vital role in your company’s success. Customers who have positive experiences are likely to return, while those who don’t can form negative opinions of your brand that they’ll share with others.
In the case of a product, UX designers are responsible for the user experience (UX) of a product. Their job is to ensure that the product logically flows from one step to the next. UX designers solve for usability first and aesthetics second.

### The five main principles of UX design
There are many important principles within UX design but to simplify things a bit, we’ve broken them down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation.
- Empathy
Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.
- Strategy
Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.
- Usability
In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. The last thing a user wants is to feel like ordering food delivery on their phone is equivalent to completing a 1000 piece puzzle. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.
- Inclusivity
A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.
Exemplary UX design incorporates the experience and needs of under-represented or oppressed groups of people and can even find solutions for their unique problems.


### UI vs UX Design: The difference between the two. 
UI design and UX design go hand-in-hand; you can’t have one without the other. 
User interface (UI) design is about making the product look good. It’s about adding colors, borders, icons, shadows, and all sorts of other visual flairs. It’s also about making sure that those elements fit into a larger whole that makes sense from both a visual and functional perspective.
User experience (UX) design is the process of systematically improving a product so that it is more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. Doing so involves considering how different parts of the product interact with each other, and how they’re perceived by users.

### So what’s the difference?
Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX design is a more analytical and technical field, UI design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex. 

### Conclusion
UI and UX work together but are different. UX design is more analytical. It’s rooted in cognitive behaviour and human psychology. UI design software is focused more on the visuals—or whether a product is aesthetically pleasing.
The UX design process is the framework or strategy that guides how a designer or team of designers tackles a project. It’s the series of steps or actions a designer takes to best solve a problem for their user.
