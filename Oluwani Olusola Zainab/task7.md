# Distinguish between UI design and UX design

1. UX makes interfaces useful, UI makes interfaces beautiful 
2. UX helps users accomplish goals, and UI makes emotional connections
 3. UX is employed across products, interfaces, and services, UI-only interfaces

## The main difference to bear in mind is this:
 UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is all about how the product's interfaces look and function. UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems, UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.

# Understand problem-solving using UX design

The main goal of UX designers should be to solve the given problem in the best possible way. For this purpose, they need to follow the below steps:

1. Understand the problem
2. Devise a plan to solve it
3. Follow the plan and define solutions
4. Test the solutions
5. Iterate and Improve

These steps can be mapped to any problem you face in everyday life. Design works similarly. The first step is to understand the problem. To understand the problem, as a UX designer, you need to meet with the users who are facing the problem and what they want to resolve it.

After understanding the problem, you will devise a plan to work on its solution. What areas do you need to explore and what steps you will follow to define the solution?

Then you need to work on the plan and identify different solutions that can help to resolve the problem. After you worked on the solutions, there is a need to test those solutions with real users. This will help you get their feedback and thus iterate and improve the solution.

# Differentiate between “Good UX’ and “Bad UX”

Good UX adds better usability, interaction, visual appeal, and information structure to your product, which increases user satisfaction and sales in return. With good UX design, users are more likely to be able to complete their goals with lesser effort and without frustration.

The opposite holds for bad UX where it takes more effort, time, and requirements for users to get what they want. Consequently, they choose a better product helping them to get things done better, which results in a sales decrease.

In short, good UX helps users to complete their goals in the most efficient way possible, bad UX stays in the way and prevents users from completing their goals.

# different areas of UX (career-wise)

A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the lens of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:

1. Experience Strategy (ExS)
2. User Research (UR)
3. Information Architecture (IA)
4. Interaction Design (IxD)

# Some laws of UX

1. zeigarnik effect.  This happens with all of us, when we have some important task to do, and when we forget to do it, we tend to feel bad about it; this is the zeigarnik effect.
It states that we remember uncompleted and uninterrupted tasks more than the completed task.

2. Fitts law states that the larger the distance and smaller the size of the target, the longer it will take.
According to this law, fast movement and smaller targets result in greater error rates, due to the speed-accuracy tradeoff.

3. Hick’s law states that the time to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

4. Jacob’s law states that when users are used to using a product, then users build their expectations around one familiar product that appears similar.


5. Law of pragnanz
This law states that we interpret complex images in the simplest form possible because it require very little cognitive effort to interpret.
Research confirms that people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures.

6. Miller’s Law states that an average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus) in their working memory. Organizing content in smaller chunks will help users to understand, process and memorize easily.
