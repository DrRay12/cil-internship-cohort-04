# The OSI Model
The OSI Model or simply put the open system interconnection model is seven (7) logical,
layers that allows you to think about networking problem and then figure out how to try to fix the problem.
The layers from top to bottom are listed below;
* layer 7: Application Layer-this is the layer that the user is actually interacting with. e.g firefox chrome and other internet browsers.
* layer 6: Presentation Layer-this is the layer that the operating system works on.
* layer 5: Session Layer-this is the layer that deals with the communication creating a session between two computers.
* Layer 4: Transport Layer-this layer decides how much information should be sent at one time, it helps to decides how much information is being sent back and forth
* Layer 3: Network Layer-this is the layer that router network operator.
* Layer 2: Datalink Layer-this layer is responsible for switching operator between computers.
* Layer 1: Physical Layer- this involves all the physical components that connect the computers together e.g cable. According to the IT Specialist, 95% of networking problem are physical problem.
