### Networking
A Computer Network is a group of two or more interconnected computer systems that use common connection protocols for sharing various resources and files. You can establish a computer network connection using either cable or wireless media. Every network involves hardware and software that connects computers and tools.

### Different Types of Computer Networks
There are various types of Computer Networking options available. The classification of network in computers can be done according to their size as well as their purpose.

## 1) What is PAN (Personal Area Network)?
PAN (Personal Area Network) is a computer network formed around a person. It generally consists of a computer, mobile, or personal digital assistant. PAN can be used for establishing communication among these personal devices for connecting to a digital network and the internet.

## 2) What is a LAN (Local Area Network)?
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computer and peripheral devices which are connected in a limited area such as school, laboratory, home, and office building. It is a widely useful network for sharing resources like files, printers, games, and other application. The simplest type of LAN network is to connect computers and a printer in someone’s home or office. In general, LAN will be used as one type of transmission medium. It is a network which consists of less than 5000 interconnected devices across several buildings.

## 3) What is WAN (Wide Area Network)?
WAN (Wide Area Network) is another important computer network that which is spread across a large geographical area. WAN network system could be a connection of a LAN which connects with other LAN’s using telephone lines and radio waves. It is mostly limited to an enterprise or an organization.

## 4) What is MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)?
A Metropolitan Area Network or MAN is consisting of a computer network across an entire city, college campus, or a small region. This type of network is large than a LAN, which is mostly limited to a single building or site. Depending upon the type of configuration, this type of network allows you to cover an area from several miles to tens of miles.

Apart from above mentioned computer networks, here are some other important types of networks:

# 1) WLAN
WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) helps you to link single or multiple devices using wireless communication within a limited area like home, school, or office building. It gives users an ability to move around within a local coverage area which may be connected to the network. Today most modern day’s WLAN systems are based on IEEE 802.11 standards.

# 2) Storage-Area Network (SAN)
A Storage Area Network is a type of network which allows consolidated, block-level data storage. It is mainly used to make storage devices, like disk arrays, optical jukeboxes, and tape libraries.

# 3) System-Area Network
System Area Network is used for a local network. It offers high-speed connection in server-to-server and processor-to-processor applications. The computers connected on a SAN network operate as a single system at quite high speed.

# 4) Passive Optical Local Area Network
POLAN is a networking technology which helps you to integrate into structured cabling. It allows you to resolve the issues of supporting Ethernet protocols and network apps.
POLAN allows you to use optical splitter which helps you to separate an optical signal from a single-mode optical fiber. It converts this single signal into multiple signals.

# 5) Home Area Network (HAN):
A Home Area Network is always built using two or more interconnected computers to form a local area network (LAN) within the home. For example, in the United States, about 15 million homes have more than one computer.
These types of network connections help computer owners to interconnect with multiple computers. This network allows sharing files, programs, printers, and other peripherals.

# 6) Enterprise Private Network :
Enterprise private network (EPN) networks are build and owned by businesses that want to securely connect numerous locations in order to share various computer resources.

# 7) Campus Area Network (CAN):
A Campus Area Network is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a specific geographical area. For example, a university campus can be linked with a variety of campus buildings to connect all the academic departments.

# 8) Virtual Private Network:
A VPN is a private network which uses a public network to connect remote sites or users together. The VPN network uses “virtual” connections routed through the internet from the enterprise’s private network or a third-party VPN service to the remote site.
It is a free or paid service that keeps your web browsing secure and private over public WiFi hotspots.

## Internet protocol
An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3. When we want to access a website like www.blogspot.com, we’re actually going to their IP address like 172.217.6.46. Devices that can connect to a network have another unique identifier called a MAC address. MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device. When you send or receive data through a network, you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.

## IPV4, IPV6, and NAT
So far we have come across IP addresses but we haven’t actually gone into detail about them. They are actually different versions of IP addresses. The current Protocol, Internet Protocol version four or IPv4 is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups. Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPv4 addresses, there are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses. There are way more than 4.3 billion websites out on the web today. Some IPv4 addresses are even reserved for special purposes. So, the number of usable IP addresses is even less. A device that wants to connect to the internet, needs to have an IP address but devices around the world have already exceeded those numbers. So, where have we been getting IP addresses? T hanks to IPv6 or Internet Protocol version six addresses. IPv6 addresses consist of a 128 bits, four times the amount that IPv4 uses. With IPv6 there are 2 to the 128 power possible IP addresses, It is a crazy large number. Just know that we will not be running out of IPv6 addresses anytime soon.

## About IPv4 Subnet Calculator
Enter IP address and netmask (decimal separated by dots (e.g. 255.255.255.0), CIDR (e.g. 29) or a Cisco wildcard (e.g. 0.0.0.31) and the IPv4 subnet calculator will calculate the broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, host range and quantity of hosts. Online and for free. The wildcard is the inverse netmask used for access control lists (ACL's) in Cisco routers.
This free online IPv4 subnet calculator also can be used as a teaching tool and presents the subnetting results as easy-to-understand binary values.
We can see two things: all host bits are zeroes in a network address, in a broadcast address they are all set. First bits determine the class of your network from A to E. A, B and C are commonly used. Each class has a range of valid IP addresses.
Address Range of Class A - 1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.254 (supports 16 million hosts on each of 127 networks).
Class B - 128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254 (65,000 hosts on each of 16,000 networks).
Class C - 192.0.1.1 to 223.255.254.254 (254 hosts on each of 2 million networks).
Class D - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (address range reserved for multicast groups).
Class E - 240.0.0.0 to 254.255.255.254 (reserved for future use, research and development purposes).

The range of private addresses in each of the different Classes, A, B, and C:
Class A – 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
10.0.0.0 /8
10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0.
Class B – 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
172.16.0.0 /12
172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0
Class C – 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
192.168.0.0 /16
192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0
