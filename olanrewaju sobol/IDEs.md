## What is a software IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. IDEs are software development tools developers use to simplify their programming and design experience. IDEs come with an integrated user interface that combines everything a developer needs to write codes conveniently. The best IDEs are built with features that allow developers to write and edit code with a code editor, debug code with a debugger, compile code with a code compiler and automate some software development tasks.

## Why are IDEs important in software programming?
IDEs provide a lot of support to software developers, which was not available in the old text editors. The best IDEs around do not need to be manually configured and integrated as part of the setup process. Instead, they enable developers to begin developing new apps on the go.

## Standard features of an IDE
# 1) Text editor
Almost all IDEs will offer a text editor made specifically for writing and modifying source code. While some tools may allow users to drag and drop front-end elements visually, the majority offers a straightforward user interface that emphasizes language-specific syntax.

## 2) Debugger
Debugging tools help developers identify and correct source code mistakes. Before the application is published, programmers and software engineers can test the various code parts and find issues.

## 3) Compiler
The compiler feature in IDE assists programmers in translating programming languages into machine-readable languages such as binary code. The compiler also helps to ensure the accuracy of these machine languages by analyzing and optimizing them.

## 4) Code completion
This feature helps developers to intelligently and automatically complete common code components. This process helps developers to save time and reduces bugs that come from typos.

## 5) Programming language support
Although some IDEs are pre-configured to support one programming language, others offer multi-programming language support. Most times, in choosing an IDE, users have to figure out which programming languages they will be coding in and pick an IDE accordingly.

## 6) Integrations and plugins
Integration capability is one feature that makes an IDE stand out. IDEs support the integration of other development tools through plugins to enhance productivity.

## Classifications of IDEs
IDEs come in different types and according to the programming languages they support. While some support one language, others can support more than one.

## 1) Multi-language IDE
Multi-language IDEs are IDE types that support multiple programming languages. This IDE type is best suited for beginner programmers still at the exploration stage. An example of this type of IDE is the Visual Studio IDE. It’s popular for its incredible supporting features. For example, users can easily code in a new programming language by adding the language plugin.

## 2) Mobile development IDE
As the market for mobile app development grows, numerous programming tools are becoming available to help software developers build efficient mobile apps. Mobile development IDEs for the Android and iOS platforms include Android Studio and Xcode.

## 3) Web/cloud-based IDE
If an enterprise supports a cloud-based development environment, it may need to adopt a cloud-based IDE. One of the advantages of using this type of IDE is that it can run heavy projects without occupying any computational resources in a local system. Again, this type of IDE is always platform-independent, making it easy to connect to many cloud development providers.

## 4) Specific-language IDE
This IDE type is a typical opposite of the multiple-language IDE. They are specifically built to support developers who work on only one programming language. Some of these IDEs include Jcreator for Java, Idle for Python and CodeLite for C++

## Visual Studio
# Microsoft Visual Studios
The Visual Studio IDE is a Microsoft-powered integrated development interface developed to help software developers with web developments. The IDE uses artificial intelligence features to learn from the edit programmer’s make to their codes, making it easy for it to complete lines of code automatically.
One of the top features many developers have come to like about Visual Studio is that it aids collaborative development between teams in live development. This feature is very crucial, especially during the debugging process. The IDE also allows users to share servers, comments and terminals.
Visual Studio has the capability to support mobile app, web and game development. It also supports Python language, Node.js, ASP.NET and Azure. With Visual Studio, developers can easily create a development environment in the cloud.

## AWS Cloud9 IDE
# AWS Cloud9
The AWS Cloud9 IDE is packed with a terminal, a debugger and a code editor, and it supports popular programming languages such as Python and PHP.
With Cloud9 IDE, software developers can work on their projects from almost anywhere in the globe as long as they have a computer that is connected to the internet, because it is cloud-based. Developers may create serverless applications using Cloud9 and easily collaborate with different teams in different development environments.

# Eclipse
Eclipse is one of the most popular IDEs. It’s a cross-platform tool with a powerful user interface that supports drag and drop. The IDE is also packed with some important features such as static analysis tools, debugging and profiling capabilities. Eclipse is enterprise development-friendly and it allows developers to work on scalable and open-source software development easily.
Although Eclipse is best associated with Java, it also supports multiple programming languages. In addition, users can add their preferred plugins to the IDE to support software development projects.
