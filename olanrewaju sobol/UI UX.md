# Case study on YouTube

### Good UX 

1. Usability: Learnability
As soon as you enter YouTube’s desktop or mobile app (if signed in), you are automatically greeted by recommended videos based on your video watching patterns or (if you are signed out) on what’s currently trending. Its intelligent algorithm system makes sure that the user will have something interesting to watch even if they don’t know where to begin

2. Gradual Updates
Updates are quite gradual as not to overwhelm the user with sudden changes. Even a child could navigate their way through the app and wouldn’t be severely impacted by YouTube’s frequent updates. 

3. Memorability. 
If you write something incorrectly in the search bar, suggested text will appear and try to match videos to what you’re trying to search for as much as possible until you end up finding the right video.

### Bad UX

1. Dark Patterns
 These are the tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn’t mean to, YouTube recommender algorithm
is so good It gets me every time as I uselessly try to stop myself from watching another video after  completing a 2-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, or even a 14-minute video! The endless list of recommended videos never ceases to capture my attention.

2. Youtube Ads
Ads are constantly annoying since they appear when I least expect them. The majority of the time, I can't wait to click the skip button.








# Fundamentals of UI and UX

### Introduction
User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are two words that you might hear mentioned frequently in tech circles (and sometimes interchangeably). But what do the terms actually mean, and what does it mean to be a UX or UI designer?
UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app, or other electronic device. UX refers to the entire interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction. While UI can certainly have an impact on UX, the two are distinct, as are the roles that designers play.
UI design refers to user interface design, while UX design stands for user experience design.UI is how something looks and how you interact with it. UX is how something works.

### Difference between UI and UX
Developing a product that people love often requires both good UI and good UX. For example, you could have a banking app that looks great and has intuitive navigation (UI). But if the app loads slowly or makes you click through numerous screens to transfer money (UX), it doesn’t matter how good it looks.  You’re probably not going to want to use it.
On the other hand, a website could be loaded with unique, helpful content organized in a logical and intuitive way. But if it looks dated or you can’t easily figure out how to move between screens or scroll through options, you’re likely to click away from the site.

### What is User Interface (UI) Design?
Interaction design focuses on how a user interacts with specific elements of a digital product. This quadrant looks at the structure and behavior of interactive systems, and how they can be designed and optimized for human use.
Interaction designers answer questions such as what happens when a user clicks a button or how will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app. Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.
Other Specialist Career Paths for UX designers
UX design is an ever-growing field, offering plenty of opportunities to both specialize and diversify.
UI design is the process of creating software or digital device interfaces with an emphasis on aesthetics or style. Designers strive to produce appealing, user-friendly designs.
Making user interactions as easy and effective as feasible is the aim of user interface design.

### 5 fundamental elements of interface design
Language.
Colour.
Imagery.
Typography.
Icons.

A well-designed user interface makes it easier to complete the task at hand without calling attention to itself. By affecting how the user interacts with the interface and enhancing the design's visual appeal, graphic design and typography are used to promote usability. Design aesthetics may either improve or impair users' ability to use the interface's features.

### Why is the user interface design important? 
User interface design is crucial since it has the power to increase or decrease your clientele. It may mean the difference between an app or website succeeding or failing. It may also determine whether visitors to your website remain or leave.

### What is UX design?
User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating.
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.
UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience design encompasses traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.

### The 5 Key Principles Of User Experience Design
Hierarchy.
Consistency.
Confirmation.
User Control.
Accessibility.

### Why is User Experience Design important? 
n the case of a website, UX design includes everything from aesthetics to whether or not a site is usable, and it plays a vital role in your company’s success. Customers who have positive experiences are likely to return, while those who don’t can form negative opinions of your brand that they’ll share with others.
In the case of a product, UX designers are responsible for the user experience (UX) of a product. Their job is to ensure that the product logically flows from one step to the next. UX designers solve for usability first and aesthetics second.

### UI vs UX Design: The difference between the two. 
UI design and UX design go hand-in-hand; you can’t have one without the other. 
User interface (UI) design is about making the product look good. It’s about adding colors, borders, icons, shadows, and all sorts of other visual flairs. It’s also about making sure that those elements fit into a larger whole that makes sense from both a visual and functional perspective.
User experience (UX) design is the process of systematically improving a product so that it is more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. Doing so involves considering how different parts of the product interact with each other, and how they’re perceived by users.

### So what’s the difference?
Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX design is a more analytical and technical field, UI design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex. 

### Conclusion
While UX designers tend to be well-versed in all of the above fields, most will only choose to focus on one or two in their careers. These quadrant principles are explained in detail below.
Experience Strategy (ExS)
UX design is not just about the user; it also brings huge value to the business providing the product or service. Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.

If you choose to focus on experience strategy, you might find yourself in the role of UX strategist. UX strategists work closely with both the design team and key business stakeholders (product owners, managers, etc.); it is their job to make sure that everyone is serving the right users while simultaneously aligning with the strategic goals of the business. In short, UX strategists see to it that all the moving parts of a business work together in harmony.
User Research (UR)

User research is a crucial component of the UX design process. Indeed, all UX designers must master the art of user research—and some will even choose to specialize in this area.

As the job title suggests, UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users. As a UX research specialist, you can expect to work closely with the product team to identify research questions, plan and lead user research sessions (such as interviews, surveys, usability tests, etc.), and share your insights in order to inform the product strategy. Some additional roles often associated with the user research quadrant include Usability Analyst and Research Analyst.
Information Architecture (IA)

This is the science of organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly way. If you are designing a website or app, the information architecture has a huge impact on how easy it is to navigate—so, as a UX designer, you will need to understand the principles of IA.

If you decide to specialize in this aspect of UX, you could end up working as an information architect. Information architecture has roots in both cognitive psychology and library science—you can think of information architects as user-centric digital librarians. As an information architect, you may be responsible for assessing the IA of an existing product, planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labeling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies.

UI and UX work together but are different. UX design is more analytical. It’s rooted in cognitive behaviour and human psychology. UI design software is focused more on the visuals—or whether a product is aesthetically pleasing.
The UX design process is the framework or strategy that guides how a designer or team of designers tackles a project. It’s the series of steps or actions a designer takes to best solve a problem for their user.
