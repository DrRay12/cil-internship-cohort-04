## Software Development Process
Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work.

## Scrum framework:
A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.- During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.- The team has a certain amount of time, a sprint, to complete its work usually two to four weeks but meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).- Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.- At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable, as in  ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a  stakeholder.- The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.- As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

Scrum  is one of Agile methodologies design as a Project management framework that helps organizations in project management, product management, software development. Etc. Unlike the waterfall approach where the steps involve in project managements are Requirements, Design, Development, Testing and Maintenance. Scrum looks at splitting software development process into small concrete deliveries in order of priorities. Instead of taking longer time to deliver a product/project, it takes short time. The scrum team are headed by a scrum master who coordinates and make sure the team follows the plan. There is a daily scrum meeting to access what has been accomplished so far, what will be done differently and what challenges were faced during the previous day

## Benefit of Scrum in software development

# 1) Periodic delivery for continous improvement:
It is important to make periodic deliveries to have the possibility of adding functionalities to the product in an incremental way. Periodic deliveries provide space for continuous improvement while allowing us to manage customer expectations better and to adapt to his/her need.

# 2) Autonomy and empowerment:
One of the great benefits of Scrum is the high degree of autonomy the team members acquire, encouraging and empowering them to perform increasingly complex tasks, thus distributing knowledge knowing that, if necessary, there is another member who is able to perform a certain task.

# 3) Product quality to have happy clients:
Metrics are used to get the product to have high quality standards with partial deliveries every 2 weeks. The metrics are calculated each time an iteration ends and determines how the progress is in the development of the product allowing the team to concentrate on those things to improve in order to deliver the best restult.

# 4) Higher productivity:
Team collaboration and engagements enables/foster high productivity. I.e. successful delivery of each backlog gives the team a sense of achievement and productiveness instead of working on a single project/product for a long period of time.

# 5) Lower Cost:
working on a project/product for a whole year or two years costs a lot of money and for example if after the whole development the product/project failed during the testing phase then all the money spent so far is wasted. But splitting these tasks into small deliverables and making sure each backlog works will save time and cost.

# 6) Better Employee Morale:
scrum improves employee morale.

7) Greater ability to incorporate changes as they occur.

8) Enable Better engagement with the customer and also improves customer satisfaction.

9) Foster Faster Return on investment and Reduced Risk.


From the Agile Manifesto

# 1) Individuals and interactions over:
The first value in the Agile Manifesto is “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Valuing people more highly than processes or tools is easy to understand because it is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process. If the process or the tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change and less likely to meet customer needs. Communication is an example of the difference between valuing individuals versus process. In the case of individuals, communication is fluid and happens when a need arises. In the case of process, communication is scheduled and requires specific content.

# 2) Working software over:
Historically, enormous amounts of time were spent on documenting the product for development and ultimate delivery. Technical specifications, technical requirements, technical prospectus, interface design documents, test plans, documentation plans, and approvals required for each. The list was extensive and was a cause for the long delays in development. Agile does not eliminate documentation, but it streamlines it in a form that gives the developer what is needed to do the work without getting bogged down in minutiae. Agile documents requirements as user stories, which are sufficient for a software developer to begin the task of building a new function.

# 3) Customer collaboration over:
Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery, with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated. Collaboration is a different creature entirely. With development models such as Waterfall, customers negotiate the requirements for the product, often in great detail, prior to any work starting. This meant the customer was involved in the process of development before development began and after it was completed, but not during the process. The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborates throughout the development process, making. This makes it far easier for development to meet their needs of the customer. Agile methods may include the customer at intervals for periodic demos, but a project could just as easily have an end-user as a daily part of the team and attending all meetings, ensuring the product meets the business needs of the customer.

# 4) Responding to change over:
Traditional software development regarded change as an expense, so it was to be avoided. The intention was to develop detailed, elaborate plans, with a defined set of features and with everything, generally, having as high a priority as everything else, and with a large number of many dependencies on delivering in a certain order so that the team can work on the next piece of the puzzle.
