1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development. 


Definition of Scrum 
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to 
reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software 
development. 

The goal of a scrum in software development is to perform at a high-performing 
level like a rugby team does in a scrum. 
 
How Scrum Works 
IWhen it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by developers putting their heads together to address complex problems. 

Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. a product backlog. The 
team meets to discuss: 
o The backlog. 
o What still needs to be completed. 
o How long it will take. 


• Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints: 
o Sprints are periods when software development is done. 
o A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the 
backlog. 
o The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product. 
o Each sprint ends with a sprint review. 
o Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which will start a new 
sprint. 
o Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent. 
• In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans 
for that day. 
o The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes. 
o Each team member needs to be present and prepared. 
o The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal. 
 
 
Benefits of Scrum 
Software developers use scrum to move their projects quickly. And the benefits trickle down to software 
developers: 
• Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends 
to be high. 
• Each sprint produces a product that is ready for the market even though the project is ongoing. 
The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be 
on the market. 
• The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. 
Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they 
are needed. 
• Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to: 
o Decreased time to market. 
o Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less 
costly. 
o Defects that are fewer and less costly. 
o Projects fail early and quickly when it’s less costly. 
• Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout 
development. 
• Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
