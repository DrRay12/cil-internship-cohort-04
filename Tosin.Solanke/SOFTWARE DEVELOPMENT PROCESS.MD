Scrum is a lightweight agile tool which splits an entire product management process into smaller concrete deliverables and also splits the entire organisation into smaller cross-functioning and self-organising teams. The goal of this tool is to make the bulkload of the work easier by dividing the entire work process into small sprints. Each sprint is organised in a way that small deliverables are produced at the end. At the end of each sprint, these iterations are released for retrospection and during meetings with all the team members involved in the process, including stakeholders, poduct owner and scrum master would decide what stays and what goes.
Features are decided by user stories, because with scrum, customers needs are a top priority, as long as they align with the stakeholders demands and budget. Product managers who use the scrum tool find it most efficient as it is cost effective, is quite flexible, and allows for changes to be made with ease. Unlike the waterfall methodology, scrum allows for progress and changes to be made at each level, which is why it is one of the most popular tools used by product managers worldwide.
