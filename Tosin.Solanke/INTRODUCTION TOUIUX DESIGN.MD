Based on the articles given for us to read, its quite easy now to distinguish the difference between User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX). From my findings, one can see that UI  basically has to do with the layout and generaal outlook of the product.From one of the laws of UI, its been shown from study that an aesthetcally pleasing design is generally perceived by users as a functionng one, and thus are naturally attracted by it.Thus, UI tends to ean towards making the product interactive by adding features and buttons to make navigation of the product easy to use. 
UX which stands for User experience has to do with the overall feeling, experience or interaction a user has with the product. How does a user feel while using the product? Does the product satisfy the purpose for which it was created? The main goal of UX is to make sure that the user has the best and utmost experience while interacting with the product. If the user feels frustration in the process, the goal of the UX designer has been defeated.
With this in mind, we can also see that in UI/UX, there are different career paths. We have UX researchers, UX writers, Interaction Designers, Motion Designers, etc. when one ventures into this path, one can start out as a generalists, having ideas on how all the career paths work. However, as time goes on and such a person gains more experience, it is possible for one to decide which career path to focus on.
