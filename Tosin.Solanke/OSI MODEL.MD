For me, another model that is quite familiar with the OSI model is the TCP/IP model. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. 
The OSI model which has 7 layers, which are the Application layer, Presentation layer, Session layer, Transport layer, Network layer, Data Link layer and Physical layer.
The TCP/IP model has four layers, unlike the OSI model, as some of the layers in the OSI model were collapsed into one layer.
The layers in the TCP/IP model are the Application layer, Transport layer, Internet layer and Network interface.
Similarities between the OSI model and TCP/IP model include the fact that both models define the standard of networking, divide the network communication process into layers.
What makes both processes unique is also the fact that they simplify the troubleshooting process by dividing complex functions into simpler components. 
They are also both logical models that allow manufacturers make devices that can work and be compatible with other devices made by other manufacturers.
This shows how the OSI model is very similar with the TCP/IP model.
