# **UI/UX Tutorial Documntation**
## **Tutorial 1**
This tutorial gives an overview of "UX Design". It covers basic concepts and definition of User Experience(UX) and User Experience (UX) Design. It gives a quick look at where UX design comes from and succintly differentiated between a Good UX and Bad UX with examples for better undertanding.

Summarily, **UX** describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. **UX design** considers each and every element that shapes the user experience and designs for a delightful user experience. The term UX was first coined in 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist and pioneer of user centered design.

When analyzing a user experience, you can start by comparing the experience to industry standards for “good UX.” A product with good UX will be: Useful, usable, desirable, findable, accessible, and credible.

## **Tutorial 2**
This tutorial introduces a typical UX design process and how UX designers, UI designers and development team work together.

A typical UX design begins with **user research**, which is user-centered approach to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave. 

Having understood the pain points and needs of the user, a UX deigner crafts a **user personas**, which is a fictional but realistic representation of a set of target users based on their goals, needs, and behaviors (all discovered during the research phase!). UX designer also crafts the **user flows**, which is how a typical user interacts or uses a product or service.

After mapping a user's journey, UX designer starts to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that’s intuitive and easy for the user to navigate. This is achieved through **wireframes** and **prototypes**. 

A wireframe is like a blueprint, demonstrating the layout of the design and how it will function. A prototype is essentially a scaled-down version of the final product—a simulation or sample version which allows you to test your ideas and designs before you get them developed.

The next phase is user testing. The most common type is the **user testing**, which helps get feedback from those who will be using the product and also helps catch a design flaw and adjust for feedbacks. 

There exists series of testings, design improvement, prototyping and testing again performed before handing off to a visual designer, usually a **user interface designer**.

**UI designers** also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars. 

After a successful creation of a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design, it is then handed over to the **development team** who will bring your designs to life and turn them into functional products.

## **Tutorial 3**
This tutorial introduces the UX design quadrant model which presents a great view to areas of specialization in UX design. It also describes some other specialist career paths for UX designers.

The UX design quadrant model groups the field into four main disciplines:
- **Experience Strategy** - Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company. Popular role is this quadrant is UX strategist.

- **User Research** - UX researchers focuses on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users. 

- **Information Architecture** - This is the science of organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly way. specializing in this quadrant makes you an information architect.

- **Interaction Design** - This focuses on how a user interacts with specific elements of a digital product. This quadrant looks at the structure and behaviour of interactive systems, and how they can be designed and optimized for human use. A specialization here makes you an Interaction Designer.

Some other specialist career paths in UX design include UX writing, Voice designer, UX developer and UI/UX designer.

## **Tutorial 4**
This tutorial looks at te important soft skills and hard skills needed as a UX designer

**Soft skills** are a combination of personal attributes and social and communication skills. They’re harder to measure than technical skills, but are increasingly valued in the workplace. Most important soft skills to have as a UX designer includes: 
- Communication
- Empathy
- Organization

**Hard skills** are the technical and functional skills required by a job. Unlike soft skills, they’re job-specific, and they’re usually measured by performance. They include:
- User Research
- Information Architecture
- Wireframing and Prototyping

## **Tutorial 5**
This tutorial describes a UX Design Portfolio, highlights UX design case study, UX design portfolio samples and how to start building your design portfolio.

**UX Design Portfolio** is an online exhibition of a UX designer’s work. It’s a personal website that introduces you as a designer and showcases a selection of projects that you’ve worked on. The aim of your UX portfolio is to demonstrate your process—not just the end result.

**UX design case studies** help you tell the story of a particular project. They use both text and images to showcase an entire UX process—from discovery to solution and everything in between. At the end of each case study, you can also include outcomes and success metrics; in other words, what impact did the project have? How did you improve the experience for the end user and for the business?
