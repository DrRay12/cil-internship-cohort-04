# **UI/UX Fundamentals**

## **What is UX?**
UX denotes User Experience. UX describes the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service. It is a user's full experience from first contact with a product or service, through to the last, including all services that support a product or service value. 

Don Norman, a cognitive scientist credited with coining the term "user experience" in late 1990s describe it thus:
> “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”

## **What is User Experience (UX) Design?**
According to a study from the Oxford Journal Interacting With Computers: 
>  The goal of UX design in business is to “improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product.”

User Experience (UX) Design is a process of designing a product (digital or pyhsical) that is easy to use, delightful to interact with, and satisfies the needs of the customer. It is an extensive process that spans through the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

## **What is UI?**
UI denotes User Interface. A user interface is the point of human-computer interaction and communication on a device, webpage, or app. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse, and the appearance of a desktop.

### Some various types of user interfaces are:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Menu-driven Interface (MDI)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Form based Interface 
- Natural Language Interface

## **What is UI Design?**
User Interface (UI) Design describes the aesthetic design of all visual elements of a digital product's user interface. It involves designing the look, feel and interactivity of a digital product.

Imagine you’re using an app on your smartphone to book flights. The screens you navigate, the buttons you tap and the forms you fill out are all part of the user interface.

## **Differences between UI and UX**
It is worthy to note that UI and UX are widely used interchangeably, however there are notable differences. 

- UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.
- UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the structure and strategy of the user journey; the UI designer complements this with visual and interactive elements for the user experience.
- UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is specific to digital products and experiences.

## **UI/UX Design Nice to Have Skills**
Becoming a UI/UX Designer requires having or developing some important skills. These skills can be grouped into Soft skills, hard or industry related skills, and crossover skills.

**Soft skills** often relate to personality traits, emotional intelligence, and situational awareness. These are non-technical skills that usually require little to no formal training. They include the following:
- Interpersonal, Collaborative and Communication Skills - To be a great UI/UX designer is to be a great communicator and collaborator as you will be communicating with users,  collaborating with teams and relating with stakeholders at all levels of your design journey.
-  Empathy - Having empathy for and understanding other people’s frustrations can make you better equipped at finding a solution for them is a crucial responsibility for any UX designer. Listening attentively to user feedback is a great way to understand the problem at hand in order to find meaningful and useful solutions to it.
- Problem Solving and or Critical Thinking - Simply put, UX designers must be able to gather significant information and put it to use in a purposeful and relevant way. Ways to boost critical thinking skills include questioning basic assumptions, understanding your own mental processes, and developing superior foresight.

**Hard or Industry related skills** are specific to a career in UX and consist of important knowledge and abilities that all UX designers must hone and sharpen in order to be accepted as a quality designer. They include:
- Wireframing and prototyping - Your wireframes and prototypes are the best way to test your designs, catch mistakes or find ways to improve your product before it’s finalization. 
- UX Research - UX design is a user centered design which requires understanding the needs of users. This is achieved through comprehensive qualitative and quantitaive user research.
- User Testing - Learning how to test and extract what your user’s needs are is crucial to creating a useful product. Observing the way people interact with your designs, what they like, dislike, or where they get hung up can help ensure your final product is exactly what your users are looking for.

**Crossover skills** are things that you can bring to your UX career from previous occupations. They include some of the following: 
- Business Acumen
- Research skills and analytics
- Customer service
- Coding and development

## **UI/UX Design Tools**
There are various tools used by UI and UX designers to function in their roles. Some commonly used tools include:
- **Sketch** - A vector graphics editor used for drawing, wireframing, prototyping and design handoff. Sketch is considered an industry-standard design tool, used by both UX and UI designers.

- **AdobeXD** - offers the best environment for digital projects under the Adobe Creative Cloud collection of design tools. You can draw, reuse, and remix vector and build artwork to create anything from screen layouts to interactive prototypes, all in the same app.

- **Figma** - a collaborative design and prototyping tool. It features a clean interface that allows for the insertion of elements, animations, and code, to create high-fidelity prototypes.

- **Balsamiq** - a low-fidelity wireframing tool that can be used to quickly create an informal visual representation of any kind of software interface. It helps create lightning-speed wireframes with built-in UI design elements.

- **LucidChart** - is a flowchart and diagramming software with real-time collaboration and drag-and-drop functionality. It helps visualise the user journey and experiment with different design ideas.

## **Careers in UI/UX Domain**
As with every field, there are various area of specializations in the UI/UX domain. They include and not limited to the following: 
- **User Research** - UX researchers focus on all things research related. They conduct research with real users, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data about how people think, feel, and behave. They then share these insights with the entire product team, helping everyone understand the target audience and informing a user-centric design strategy.

- **Information Architect** - An information architect is a digital librarian of sorts; they structure all the content across a website or app. Their goal is to ensure a positive user experience by making the information accessible, logical, and well-organized. They consider how users interact with an existing information architecture based on data from usability tests. They use these insights to develop strategies that serve both user needs and business goals.

- **UI/UX Developer** - A UI/UX developer is best described as part-designer, part-developer. This role combines user experience and user interface design with key front-end development skills such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

- **UX Writer** - UX writers combine a deep understanding of user-centered design with a flair for copywriting. They conduct user research (or collaborate with the UX researcher) in order to understand the audience they’re writing for. They analyze existing product copy to identify potential areas for improvement—such as text sections that have unfamiliar terms—and use these insights to devise an overall UX copy strategy. Based on this strategy, they’ll write concise, user-friendly copy that guides the user through the product.

- **Usability Analyst** - A usability analyst seeks to understand what the user experiences as they interact with a digital product. They conduct ongoing usability tests on existing products in order to come up with fixes and improvements. Their role is pivotal in the development of new products, carrying out competitor analysis and leveraging data to inform design decisions.
