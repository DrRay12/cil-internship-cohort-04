# **Scrum**
Scrum is a subset of agile software development. It is a framework that helps team collaborate and work together. Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

### Overview of Scrum Framework
- Product owner creates a product backlog (this is a wishlist of task that need to be prioritized in a project).

- Split your organization into small, crosss-functional, self organizing teams.

- The Scrum team conducts a sprint planning session where the tasks necessary to complete items on the wishlist is broken down into small, concrete deliverables, and more easily manageable chunks.

- The team creates sprint/iterations backlog and plans its implementation.

- The team decides a time duration for every sprint (usually two to four weeks).

- The team holds daily standup where each member of the team shares daily updates, helping the team and the project manager assess the progress of the project.

- Optimize the release plan and update priorities in collaboration with the customers, based on insights gained by inspecting the release after each iteration/sprint.

- Optimize the process by having a retrospective after each iteration/sprint.
