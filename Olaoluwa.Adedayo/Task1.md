# **TCP/IP Model**
## What is TCP/IP?
TCP/IP is a data link protocol used on the internet to let computers and other devices send and receive data. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and makes it possible for devices connected to the internet to communicate with one another across networks.
## Difference between TCP and IP
TCP and IP are separate computer network protocols. The difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) is their role in the data transmission process. IP obtains the address where data is sent (your computer has an IP address). TCP ensures accurate data delivery once that IP address has been found. Together, the two form the TCP/IP protocol suite.
## Layers of TCP/IP Model 
There are four layers of the TCP/IP model: network access, internet, transport, and application. Used together, these layers are a suite of protocols.
- Network Access Layer - The network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that lets computers communicate with one another over the internet. This covers ethernet cables, wireless networks, network interface cards, device drivers in your computer, and so on.

- Internet Layer - The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the internet layer may take a little longer to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an error corrupting that file.
- Transport Layer - The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices. It’s like sending an insured package: The transport layer divides the data in packets, acknowledges the packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.
- Application Layer - The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. For most of us that means email, messaging apps, and cloud storage programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving data.
