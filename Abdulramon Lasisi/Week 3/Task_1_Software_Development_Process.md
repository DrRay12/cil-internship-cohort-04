# 1. SCRUM

## What is scrum

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal â€” creating a ready-for-market product.

## Benefits of Scrum

- Software developers use scrum to move their projects quickly, developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams.
- Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
- The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
- Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI).
- Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
- Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
