# Scrum
Scrum is a popular framework that works very well for innovative and complex product development projects. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

## Benefits of using Scrum

* Flexibility to allow quick product changes
It provides the capability to quickly adapt to changes in product definition and to deliver to those changes within a few iterations. To enable this adaption, the Scrum team creates or modifies backlog items to align with the needed product changes.

* Tested, stable products
Testing and version control are essential elements of any software development process. Effective testing helps to eliminate product bugs through early detection and to resolve issues through versioning.The Scrum team identifies the tools for test coverage and sets the acceptable metrics. Beyond unit testing coverage, the Scrum team performs product feature testing to validate story success criteria.

* On-time delivery
To deliver software on time in Scrum, execute the elements of Scrum, which build upon each other. Stable, well-defined sprints ensure quality and predicable increments. Communication and feedback within the sprint allow participants to identify issues and to collaborate internally and externally. This enables you to resolve blocked work and or realign the backlog for the subsequent sprint.
