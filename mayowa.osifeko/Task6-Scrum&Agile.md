# Scrum
Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams work together. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences as It acknowledges that the team doesnâ€™t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. It helps the team to self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
-	The product owner creates a product backlog (essentially, a wishlist of tasks that need to be prioritized in a project)
-	The Scrum team conducts a sprint planning session where the tasks necessary to complete items on the wishlist is broken down into small, more easily manageable chunks
-	The team creates a sprint backlog and plans its implementation
-	The team decides a time duration for every sprint (the most common interval is probably two weeks)
-	The team gets together every day for a brief Scrum meeting (often referred to as a Daily Standup) where each member of the team shares daily updates, helping the team and the project manager assess the progress of the project
-	The certified Scrum Master guides the team and keeps them focused and motivated
-	The stakeholders and the product owner conduct a review at the end of each sprint
## Benefits of scrum
-	The rules, artifacts, events, and roles are easy to understand.
-	Its semi-prescriptive approach actually helps remove the ambiguities in the development process, while giving sufficient space for companies to introduce their individual flavor to it.
-	The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects.
-	the clear demarcation of roles and planned events ensure that there is transparency and collective ownership throughout the development cycle.
-	Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
# Complete Agile manifesto
-	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
-	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
-	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
-	Responding to change over following a plan.
