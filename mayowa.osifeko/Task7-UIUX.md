# **Findings on UI/UX**
-	User experience is terminology for how you feel or react during and after you have interacted with a product.
-	User experience design is the art of crafting a plan having considered several factors to deliver a quality product that guarantees satisfaction in terms of quality and use. 
-	Wireframes are very light designs usually that give an idea of what to expect. It is more like a sketch whereby you can see the feasibility of a design before going ahead with it. 


# **UI/UX Fundamentals**
User Experience (UX) puts the end user at the focal point and defines the system from that perspective. Finding the best match between a user’s needs and a product’s use. User experience affects:
-	functionality
-	system organization and structure
-	interactions and look and feel
-	access
User Interface (UI) on the other hand is e point of interaction or communication between a computer and another entity, such as a printer or human operator. UI fulfills two key UX needs: 
-	Interactions and look and feel
-	Access
## **Good design and bad design**
Good design:
-	satisfies the user or client. 
-	does what the users need and want.
-	is natural to use.
Bad design does the opposite of the above bullet points. 
### **User-centered design**
A user-centered design operates in three steps: 
1.	Identify who the users are
2.	Identify what they want to accomplish
3.	Constantly assess (1) and (2)
### **Design stages**

Design-->Implement-->Deploy-->Evaluate

### **Expressing Designs**
-	Start with paper prototypes 
-	Move on to wireframes
## **Principles of designing UIs**
Jacob Nielsen’s 10 design principles
1.	Match the real world
2.	Maintain consistency and use standards
3.	Provide help and documentation
4.	Ensure user have control and freedom
5.	Visibility of system status
6.	Flexibility and efficiency
7.	Provide recognition, not recall
8.	Error prevention
9.	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10.	Aesthetic and minimalistic design
