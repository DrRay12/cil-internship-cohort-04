Answer
1.	Scrum is a software development framework that is both iterative and Agile. Scrum approach is that it takes into account that customers can change their minds about their needs, which might affect product development.
The Scrum framework offers the following benefits:
	Provides a quality framework. The Scrum framework ensures that the project implementing this approach is executed with an aim toward high quality. Scrum involves frequent testing of the product and considers the product owner’s feedback. This allows the team to address problems while the product is still in its development stages.
	Ensures customer satisfaction. Scrum Teams focus on customer satisfaction, and they are completely dedicated to proving good quality services. They are always involved with the customers by taking care of the customer requirements, working on making a quick delivery, and accepting the fact that the needs of the customers may change throughout the product life cycle.
	Makes quick deliveries. Scrum’s approach ensures that products are delivered to the end customers at least 30–40% faster than by using traditional methods. The quick delivery is attributable to certain factors. In particular, the development of the project is handled by the Scrum Team’s product owner, who is dedicated and responsible for providing real-time clarification and requirements at the right time.
	The priorities of the teams are separated and their work is set accordingly. The delivery is not kept on hold until the entire project has been completed..
	Cultivates good team spirit. There are many ways in which Scrum enhances team spirit and morale, which is important to increasing work productivity. Scrum Teams are self-organizing, which means that members can be innovative by using their expertise. The acknowledgment of this expertise boosts team morale.
