Question: Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model
The OSI Model was introduced to help in the transmission of data across systems. The layers across which the data can be transferred are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data link and Physical.
A model exists that has similarities to the OSI model which is the TCP/IP. TCP/IP is a data link protocol used on the internet to let computers and other devices send and receive data. Both the TCP/IP and OSI have some strong similarities such as 
	Both are logical models
	Both define standards for networking
	Both provide a framework for creating and implementing networking standards and devices
	Both divide the network communication process into layers 
	In both models, a single layer defines a particular functionality and sets standards for that functionality only
The TCP/IP model is Networks Reference Model like the OSI model. The layers of the TCP/IP model are 4. They are: Application, Transport, Network and Link layers
