## SCRUM

Scrum is a software product development strategy that splits software developers into small cross-functional, self-organizing teams to reach a common goal. It is a light-weight agile tool.

  

## What does Scrum do?
-   Split your team into small cross functional self organizing teams
-   Organize your work into a list of manageable, specific deliverables, ranking them in order of importance.
-   It splits time into brief, predetermined sprints or iterations, with each sprint ending with a demonstration of potentially shippable code.
-   Together with the client, refine the release strategy and revise priorities in light of information gained from reviewing each iteration's release.

  
  *Instead of having the waterfall approach to software development, scrum does it in such a way that all the aspects of building a product sort of feeds into each other forming a perfect cycle.*.


## Things done in scrum
A product backlog, often known as a wish list of features, serves as the basis for Scrum software development. The group gathers to talk about the work estimated with each feature, features are then ranked in order of importance which results in a ranked and weighted list of product features called roadmap.

Then the scrum master breaks these roadmap into **sprints**, *an agile software development concept* ; Sprints are times when actual program development is completed.

In order to finish an item from the backlog, a sprint typically lasts between one week and one month. The creation of a marketable product is the aim of every sprint.

Then there will be daily scrum meeting popularly known as **STANDUP** meetings where the scrum team headed by the scrum master will discuss:

- The delay

- What remains to be finished still.

- How much time it will take

  

## Who is in Scrum
-   The scrum team: software developers building
-   The scrum master: also part of the building but keeps the team in check to make sure the tasks are being completed
-   The product owner.

  

## Advantages of Scrum
-   Scrum teams are ideal for those that prefer the freedom to make their own decisions. Team spirit is typically quite high.
-   Higher returns on investment are frequently seen in Scrum initiatives (ROI).
-   Testing is dispersed across development by reviewing each sprint before the team begins the following sprint.
-   Project objectives and focus might alter when corporate objectives change.

## Disadvantages of Scrum
-   When a team member leaves, the product suffers
-   Product owners keep adding to backlog which may keep taking the scrum team backwards.

## Scrum Summary
Instead of a large team spending a lot of time building something big, scrum uses a small team spending a short time building something small but integrating regularly into the bigger project

  

  ## 2nd Task

   - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
   - Working software over comprehensive documentation
   - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
   - Responding to change over following a plan
