Breakdown Of The RFC 1918 IPv4 Address Range Into 4 Subnets.


Class A Public and Private IP Address Range
Class A addresses are for networks with a large number of total hosts. It allows for
126 networks by using the first octet for the network ID. The first bit in this octet is
always zero.
The Public IP Range is : 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
The Private IP Range is : 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
10.10.10.0 (Is a class A private IP range).


Class B Public & Private IP Address Range
Class B addresses are for medium to large sized networks. Class B network number
values begin at 128 and end at 191. Class B allows for 16,384 networks by using the
first two octets for the network ID.
The Public IP Range is : 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
The Private IP range is : 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
172.168.1.0 (This is a class B private IP Range)


Class C Public and Private IP Address Range
Class C addresses are used in small local area networks (LANs). Class C network
number values begin at 192 and end at 223. Class C allows for approximately 2
million networks by using the first three octets for the network ID.
The Public IP Range is : 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
The Private IP Range is : 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
192.168.0.0 (This is a class C Private IP Range).


Special IP Address / Loopback
The IP Range for this type of address is between 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255.
These are virtual IP addresses and can not be assigned to a device.
