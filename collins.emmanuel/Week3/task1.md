                  Describe Scrum?

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative manner. Scrum can also mean as a way to get work done as a team in small pieces at a time, with experimentation and feedback loops along the way.


BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

1. Better Productivity And Faster Delivery Time: Teams perform so well in scrum because of smart work planning.  

Any software development team that uses scrum works in predefined time periods called sprints that usually last for 1-5 weeks.
During the sprint planning meeting, the project manager guides both the development team and the product owner to define user stories, as well as end goals and users that will actually use the final product.

Making sure that team members are happy is a morale booster, which in turn have a direct impact on productivity and speed of work.
In any case whereby the development team finishes all the tasks planned for the current print before it ends, then the list of tasks called backlog with developed user stories ready to be added into the current sprint to fill in the gaps and prevent resource squander, and this enhances productivity.


2. Top End-Product Quality: A benefit of why we utilize scrum (apart from better productivity and faster delivery time) is the utmost quality of the end-product. The awareness to deliver a top-notch end-product is a deep understanding of product features by every member in a team.
Errors or misunderstandings are resolved immediately in the next daily scrum team meeting once they're are discovered.
These errors are spotted easily in scrum because larger tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable pieces during the planning phase. As a matter of fact, early detection of errors in the process higher quality and time efficiency.

The biggest advantage of managing projects within scrum is the active involvement of the product owner in the development process, this enables all factors to be checked and rechecked to make sure that everyone is focused on the main goal of delivering a superior quality products.


3. Higher ROI And Faster Time To Market:
One of the main purposes of scrum is to increase the returns of a project.
Return on Investment is actually the profits made from an investment after all expenses have been deducted. Return on Investment is the main goal in any industry.
Scrum has been proven to deliver value to customers at a rate higher than other methods.
The decrease in time to market is the reason why Scrum projects have a higher return on investment (ROI). Revenue, as well as other benefits, start coming in sooner and because of earlier accumulation, the ROI is higher over time.


4. Flexibility And Adaptability To Requirements Changes:

Another benefit of scrum in software development is that the scrum team can quickly adapt to the product requirement changes in order to provide the customer with a competitive advantage.
Although the scrum framework is created to cope with sudden changes in the development plan, big changes should definitely be avoided so that the defined budget and schedule could be successfully met, so as to avoid unwarranted delays and last minute rush to finish up the product by the team which may lead to irreversible mistake.


5. Staying Within A Specified Budget:
One of the benefits of scrum in software development is staying within a defined budget is one of the top priorities of project managers in UHP. The project budget is monitored daily and if there is an opportunity to reduce costs or speed up the project execution towards the final goal, adequate measures are planned and executed.
