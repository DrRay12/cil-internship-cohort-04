                  UI (USER INFERFACE DESIGN)

This is a designing process used by designers to create Interface, focusing on the looks or style in software or computerised devices.  It is a link between users and the brand. The bedrock of user interface is structure, communication and user manipulation. User interface is an affair that involves the users and the system being used.

The aim of User Interface Design is to create interfaces which are User favourable and pleasurable. It includes elements such as input controls, navigational components, informational components and containers.


          FUNDAMENTALS OF USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The basic fundamentals for user interface design are listed below

1. Predictable and seamless elements, such as buttons
2. Effective navigation, such as clearly labelled icons
3. Frictionless and invisible interactions
4. Purposeful and clear tasks or goals
5. Guided behaviour with design patterns, and clear hierarchy and readability
6. Key features catch the user’s attention


Designing User Interface For Designers;

User interface as defined earlier as the point of interactions between the users and the design can be in 3 formats

1. Graphical User Interface (GUIs) : This is an interface in which users use a digital control panel to interact with a visual representation. Example: A computer desktop, a phone screen.
2. Voice Controlled Interfaces (VOIs) : This is an interface which involves users interactions with their vocals. Example: Alexander on Amazon devices.
3. Gesture Based Interface (GUIs) : This is an interface which users interact via a movement of the body with 3D design spaces. Example: games, virtual reality.


        Some facts To Consider In Designing A User Interface

A good user interface has a bar on usability over liveability. Users are quick to tender judgement and as such they don’t care about designs. They are focused on getting their task done easily with minimum work done. A good user interface design is user centred, hence it is “invisible”. Users focus on the task completion and not the admiration of the design.

A good user interface design should communicate the values of the brand and reinforce users' trust. A good design is a relatable design, it is an interactive design, it is a dialoguing design that keeps communication with the users at all levels. Users stay emotionally connected to good designs.


                How To Make Great User Interface Designs

To make impressive designs, it must be user centred. Users are humans and as such, they crave comfort and lack of stress of their mental capabilities, hence the designs should follow the following guidelines:

1. It should maintain high discoverability. All icons should be clearly labelled and well indicated.

2. Buttons and other common elements should perform predictably to enable users to unconsciously use them everywhere.

3. It should be a user centred design, thus all interfaces should be kept simple with only elements that help to serve users' purpose.

4. Usability testing: the usability of the design should be tested. This is the process of gathering a group of people to interact with your website and application to see what works and what doesn’t while they are being watched.

5. Be consistent: All applications belonging to your brand should have similar elements and with this, interacting with your brand anywhere is made easy for the users.

6. Create room for communication. There should be a room for feedback so that the users can communicate when something goes right or wrong. Everything should be worded clearly in a way that everyone can easily flow.

7. Don’t Ignore typography : It is important to note that typography should be of great vitality in a design. Thus, there should be a need for research while designing the website or application to ensure that different typographies are tested and optimized for convenience.
In conclusion, the success or failure of any project depends on the user interface design.


                UX DESIGN (User Experience Design)

As defined by the International Organisation For Standardisation (ISO), User experience can be defined as

“ A person’s perception and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service”.

-ISO 9241 – 210, Ergonomics of human system interaction. Part 210 : Human -Centred design for interactive systems.

This definition can be broken down into 2 parts :

1. The person's perceptions and responses
2. The use of a product, system or service

According to the first part of the definition, designers cannot control s persons perception and response. How a user feels, moves their fingers and controls their eyes cannot be controlled by the designers as his product is utilised. However, the looks and behaviour of the product, system or service  can be controlled by the designer as stated in the 2nd part of the definition.

     User experience is the process in which a team of designers creates a product that provides important meaning and experience. It encompasses the entire process ranging from acquiring and integrating the product, all aspects of branding, designs, the product's usability and functions. A user experience designer is concerned with proffering solutions that addresses the pain points and needs of the users.

User experience design takes into consideration the users understanding and context as the starting point for all design and development.


Don Norman’s Definition Of User Experience

“No product is an island. A product is more than a product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences. Think through all of the stages of a product or service – from initial intentions through final intentions, from the first usage to help, service and main. Make them all work together seamlessly”. – Don Norman, inventor of the term “user experience”

User experience is indeed a broad world in which user interface is the sequence of phases which makes the world easy to operate.


Foundations of UX design : Below are the fundamentals on which a good user experience is built.

    1. User testing
    2. Data analytics
    3. Site mapping
    4. User satisfaction
    5. Prototyping
    6. Collaboration


    Difference between User Interface Design and User Experience Design

While the former is concerned with the surface and the overall feel of the design, the later covers the entirety of the design.  

User interface is the step by step sections of the design that makes the design easy and smooth for usage while user experience covers the entire range of the user’s experience.

User experience design is like a phone while user interfaces are like the buttons that make the phones easy to operate.  User experience design is the power house, while user interfaces are the sections that make the power house usable.


      Fundamentals Of User Interface And User Experience Design

The following fundamentals are needed to create a good interface and experience designs respectively.

1. Define your user:  It is pertinent to know who are your users and their pain points. Thus a good design must in-turn address the users pain points. 

2. Familiarize and set UI patterns:  A good design is familiar and straightforward. 

3. Be effective with communication and feedback : A good UI/UX design has a room for users to drop their feedbacks after the usage of the product. 

4. Stay consistent : A good design maintains the same brand identity across all platforms. 

5. Have strong visual hierarchy : Buttons that carries out an action should be made visible and bold and very easy to locate as compared to other buttons that do not carry out an action. 

6. Empower your users : A good design is one that gives users the power to handle all operations swiftly by themselves without the need of any intervention. 

7. Keep it simple and purposeful : A good design is not cumbersome, it is very simple and serves its purpose.
