# What is Scrum?
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal, creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.
The word scrum also is used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against each to gain possession of the ball. 
The goal of a scrum in software development is to perform at a high-performing level like a rugby team does in a scrum.

# Scrum Best Practices
Teamwork wins rugby games and helps software developers create quality products. To get the best quality out of scrum:
1.	Define requirements just in time to keep product features as relevant as possible.
2.	Test and incorporate product owner feedback daily.
3.	Sprint reviews with stakeholders need to be regular.
4.	The scrum team needs to use the sprint retrospectives to improve how they work.
5.	Conduct ace-to-face conversations to reduce miscommunications.
6.	Trust the teams to do the best job possible.
7.	Allow the teams to self-organize around people’s skills, work styles and personalities.
8.	Don’t burn out the team members. Respect the balance between their personal and professional lives to ease stress.



# Benefit of Scrum
The following are the benefits of Scrum in software development:
1.	Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
2.	Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
3.	The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
4.	Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to:
  * Decreased time to market.
  * Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
  * Defects that are fewer and less costly.
  * Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
  * Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
  * Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
