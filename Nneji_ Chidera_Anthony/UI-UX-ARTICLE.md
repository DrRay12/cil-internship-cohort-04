# Write an article on UI/UX Fundamentals

Design matters because our identities and moods are fluid and shifting, and the quality of the designed environment often determines whether we'll feel confident or defeated, at ease or guarded, generously spirited or alienated.

UX refers to User Experience, which focuses on how something works and how people interact with the product.
UI refers to User Interface, focusing on the look and layout.

UI/UX design is two different elements, but both are required for a good user experience.
Developing a product that people love often requires both good UI and UX.

### What is User Interface (UI) Design?

UI or User Interface design is designing virtual interfaces for machines and software, and it has to do mainly with how looks and styles of the design.

Once the UX designer has created the wireframe, the UI designer is tasked with creating each screen or page that a user interacts with and ensuring that the UI visually communicates the path a UX designer has laid out.

A UI design can make or break a wireframe if the imagery is unsuitable for the style or does not match the content.

### What is User Experience (UX) Design?

UX or user experience design is to plan how something looks and works to make the activity of using it easy and enjoyable.

UX design focuses on the end-user experience, including user interactions with the interface. It's about creating something that meets users' needs and provides them with value, not just something that looks nice.

## The fundamental of UI/UX Design

1. Know your user
   You need to understand your user's goals. Figure out what they like about the design, and sit down and watch how they use them. Find out about your client's abilities and experience and what they need. By focusing on your user first, you can create an interface that allows them to accomplish their objectives.

2. Pay attention to patterns
   Users spend most of their time on interfaces other than their own (Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, Bank of America, school/university, news websites, etc.). There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and those interfaces may solve some of the same problems that users perceive within the one you are creating. Using familiar UI patterns will help your users feel at home.

3. Stay consistent
   Your users need consistency and know that once they figure out how to follow through with something, they will want to use your product again. Language, layout, and design are just a few interface elements that need consistency. A consistent interface enables your users to understand better how things will work, increasing their efficiency.

4. Use visual hierarchy
   Design your interface to allow the user to focus on the most important. Each element's size, color, and placement work together, creating a clear path to understanding your interface. A clear hierarchy will go to great lengths to reduce the appearance of complexity (even when the actions themselves are complex).

5. Provide feedback
   Your interface should always speak to your user when their actions are right and wrong or misunderstood. Always inform your users of actions, changes in state and errors, or exceptions. Visual cues or simple messaging can show the user whether their actions have led to the expected result.
6. Be forgiving
   No matter how clear your design is, people will make mistakes. Your UI should allow for and tolerate user error. Design ways for users to undo actions and be forgiving with varied inputs (no one likes to start over because they put in the wrong birth date format). Also, if the user does cause an error, use your messaging as a teachable situation by showing what action was wrong and ensuring that they know how to prevent the error from occurring again.

7. Empower your user
   Once a user has experienced your interface, reward them and take off the training wheels. The breakdown of complex tasks into simple steps will become cumbersome and distracting. Providing more abstract ways, like keyboard shortcuts, to accomplish tasks will allow your design to get out of the way.

8. Speak their language
   All interfaces require some level of copywriting. Keep things conversational, not sensational. Provide clear and concise labels for actions and keep your messaging simple. Your users will appreciate it because they won't hear you â€“ they will hear themselves and their peers.

9. Keep it simple
   The best interface designs are invisible and do not contain UI-bling or unnecessary elements. Instead, the necessary elements are concise and make sense. When you think about adding a new feature or element to your interface, ask, "Does the user need this?" or "Why does the user want this very clever animated gif?" Are you adding things because you like or want them? Never let your UI ego steal the show.

10. Keep moving forward
    It is often said when developing interfaces that you need to fail fast and iterate often. When creating a UI, you will make mistakes. Just keep moving forward, and remember to keep your UI out of the way.

Beautiful designs promise goodness, and lousy design evocates nothing short of despair and bad experience. That's why beautiful design matters because it encourages a better experience.
