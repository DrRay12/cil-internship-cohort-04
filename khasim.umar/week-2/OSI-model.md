Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) Model

The TCP/IP model is a layered model that is similar to OSI layered model. They are formed in order to determine how a specific computer should be connected to another computer or the internet and how data are transmitted between them. It helps to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together. The main purpose of the TCP/IP model is to allow communication over long distances.

TCP/IP is an acronym that stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. They are designed specifically to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over unreliable internetwork.

It was originally developed in the 1970s by DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency in the US), TCP/IP started out as just one of many internet protocols. The TCP/IP model later became the standard protocol for ARPAnet, the modern internet’s predecessor. Today, TCP/IP is the global standard for internet communications.

Functions of TCP/IP
The major function or purpose of TCP/IP is the determination of how computers transfer data between each other. This data transfer needs to be kept accurate so that the receiver gets the same information or the same copy of the original data from the sender.
To ensure that each data reaches its intended destination intact, the TCP/IP model breaks down the data into smaller packets and then reassembles the packets into the complete message on the other end of the receiver. The computer sending the data in small packets makes it easier to maintain accuracy versus sending all the data at once.

After a single message is split into packets, these packets may travel along different routes if one route is congested. It is more or less like sending a few different birthday cards to the same birthday mate by mail. The cards begin their journey at your home, but you might drop each card into a different mailbox, and each card may take a different path to the recipient’s address but will definitely get there anyway.

This model actually works because the whole process is standardized. Without standardization, communication between different computers would go haywire and slow things down. As the global standard, the TCP/IP model is one of the most efficient ways to transfer data over the internet and it’s a lot similar to the OSI model.
Common Internet Protocols Used In Sending Data.

The TCP/IP model covers many internet protocols, which define how data is addressed and sent over the internet. Common Internet Protocols include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. These are often used in conjunction with the TCP/IP model.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) governs the workings of web browsers and websites.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) defines how files are sent over a network.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send and receive email.

The Difference Between TCP and IP
TCP and IP are separate computer network protocols. This means they have different purpose but work together to achieve a goal. Their differences are their roles in the data transmission process. IP obtains the address where data is sent (every computer has its own unique IP address). TCP on the other hand ensures accurate data delivery once that IP address has been located. Together, the two form the TCP/IP protocol suite.
In other words, IP sorts the mail, and TCP sends and receives the mail. While the two protocols are usually considered to work together, other protocols, such as UDP (User Datagram Protocol), can send data within the IP system without the use of TCP. But TCP requires an IP address to send data.

Layers of the TCP/IP Model
There are four different layers of the TCP/IP model which includes the Network Access Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer. These layers are a suite of protocols. The TCP/IP model passes data through these layers in a particular order when a user sends information, and then again in reverse order when the data is received.

Network Access Layer
The network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that lets computers communicate with one another over the internet. This covers ethernet cables, wireless networks, network interface cards, device drivers.

Internet Layer
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the internet layer may take a little longer to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an error corrupting that file.

Transport Layer
The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices. It’s like sending an insured package: The transport layer divides the data in packets, acknowledges the packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.

Application Layer
The application layer is the group of applications or software that let the user access the network. It is the part that let the user interact with the computer system. For instance, e-mailing, browsers and cloud storage programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving data.

IP Addresses That TCP/IP Uses
Whether a device works with IPv4 or the IPv6 address, it’s likely it using the TCP/IP model. This is the standard model for most existing internet infrastructure. There are different categories of IP addresses that may affect your privacy or how the protocol works — such as public vs. local IP addresses or static vs. dynamic IPs — they still follow the standard TCP/IP designed model.
