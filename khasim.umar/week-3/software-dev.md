WHAT IS SCRUM
Agile Methods is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world. It is centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It is flexible, and fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality, using tools like Scrum and eXtreme Programming.

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
•	A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
•	The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
•	The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
•	Repeat

Scrum is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components. Scrum is not a methodology but a set of values of philosophy. It implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solve complex problems.

Tools for Scrum Process
Some of the tools used for scrum are JIRA Software, Git Stash, Srumblr, AgileFant, iceScrum, Tackle, and Fireeye.

Importance of scrum process
ITS ADAPTABILITY
The Scrum Process is designed to embrace change. It has the ability to adapt to the development environment as it follows an empirical process control and iterative delivery method. This makes the software project adaptable and open to changes at any given point of time without affecting the development environment.

ITS IMPROVED CONTROL
One of the advantages here is that the work can be broken down among individual teams and that allows more control over each part of the process. Regular interactions and clear communication among the teams ensure improved control over the entire lifecycle of the product.

HIGHER CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
At the end of the day, customer satisfaction is one of the main goals of any work and Agile development outdoes other methodologies in this field. As it is iterative, there is continuous improvement and deliverability. The teams are able to collaborate and get feedback from the customers at every point, which helps them make changes along the way and deliver an even better product than expected.

ITS INCREASED FLEXIBILITY
In the ‘Waterfall’ method, it was necessary to plan the whole software development process ahead, and making any change was possible only after the whole process was done. Making a change was rather costly too. However, in Scrum methodology, flexibility is key, which follows the core value ‘Responding to change over following a plan. This helps bring out superior quality products.

BETTER QUALITY OF PRODUCT
One of the major advantages of this methodology is constant testing to find problems and come up with quick solutions. The flexibility allows continuous improvement in the product.

BETTER PRODUCTIVITY
As the work is broken down and assigned to teams and there are continuous discussions around it, the project is easier to manage. The incremental nature allows quicker results. This results in increased and better productivity.

HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Everything aside, return on investment is the main reason for enterprises taking up any project. The iterative nature of Agile software development methodology makes the product market ready by taking care of the continuous changes corresponding to the evolving market and changing customer needs. Using Scrum in Agile software development helps enterprises anticipate changes and come up with solutions. This means quicker benefits and higher returns. Amid the pandemic, the world has evolved drastically when it comes to technology and is moving faster. These benefits of Agile software development methodology make enterprises stay relevant and adapt to the ever-changing market.

FROM THE AGILE MANIFESTO
•	Individuals and interactions over process tools.
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
•	Responding to change over following a plan.
