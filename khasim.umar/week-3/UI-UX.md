USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating.

UX is not only related to digital products, such as websites and apps and digital space. Anything that can be experienced can be designed, from the packaging of a toothbrush to the wheels of an orthopedic chair.
The impact of good (and bad) UX is everywhere which makes it an exciting field, and also explains why you already know a lot more about UX than you realize. Every time you curse a push door that has a pull bar or closes a confusing website in frustration, you’re making a judgment on the quality of its UX design.

WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN (UXD)
User experience design, or UXD, considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It is all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.
If you think about it, humans can only benefit from complex systems like websites and computer programs (or any product, really) if these systems are somewhat user-friendly. UX designers look to bridge the gap between the product and the human user. They think about how people interact with a given product, and look for ways to make these interactions as intuitive and straightforward as possible.

UX designers have to wear many different hats, finding just the right balance between scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and artists. In order to come up with viable, creative, and user-friendly design solutions, you need to analyze past experiences, research new practices, interview real or potential users, and test, test, and test your designs.

ORIGIN OF UX DESIGN
The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple. A pioneer of user-centered design, Norman emphasized the importance of designing based on the needs and goals of the end user. In doing so, he introduced the term “user experience”, which, in Norman’s own words, is meant to encompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”

The UX Design Process
A UX designer’s job varies dramatically from project to project. However, the UX design process can generally be divided into four key phases: research, design, testing, and implementation. 
Based on these phases, UX designers tend to follow a certain sequence for each project: carrying out user research, analyzing their findings, defining user personas, mapping out user flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, conducting user testing, and finally, handing the designs over for visual design and development.
User Research

Every design process begins with research. As a UX designer, a user-centered approach is absolutely crucial; you need to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave. It is therefore really important to engage with your users directly and figure out how they think.

For instance, a UX designer tackle research by receiving a brief from the Head of Product asking to conduct initial research for a new product feature. He then starts with competitor research to see what is out there, before moving on to interviews with actual prospective users. He also surveys and interviews any existing users, as well as product stakeholders, to identify their needs, pain points, and any opportunities for improvement.
Research is essential as it helps to understand the problem a UX designer is trying to solve. It enables you the UX designer to identify pain points and challenges, validate or invalidate your assumptions, find patterns and commonalities across your target user groups, and shed plenty of light on your users’ needs and objectives. Ultimately, research ensures that a UX designer designs with the user in mind—the golden rule of UX.

User Research Analysis—Affinity Mapping
Having conducted extensive user research, it is time to analyze your findings and turn them into meaningful insights. In other words, what does the data tell you about the product you’re designing and the people you’re designing it for? At this point, you organize all research—be it audio recordings of interviews or hand-written notes—and start to look for common themes and patterns. 

One of my favorite research analysis techniques as a UX designer is affinity mapping. All you need is a whiteboard or a blank wall and some post-it notes. On each Post-it notes, you write down an observation or quote from your research, before grouping your post-its into similar clusters. The end result is a wall or whiteboard filled with sticky notes and, most importantly, themes that can be used to draw meaningful insights from your data. 
User Personas and User Flows

Armed with meaningful insights from the research phase, I then get to work on crafting user personas of my favorite tasks as a UX designer. A user persona is a fictional but realistic representation of a set of target users based on their goals, needs, and behaviors (all discovered during the research phase).

A user persona is an extremely valuable tool in the UX design process as it reminds designers and other stakeholders that they are designed for real people. Rather than designing for user group A and user group B, I will design for “Jane”, a mother of two living in London, and “Steve”, a recent retiree in the process of relocating to Rome. Using this logic helps the designer to build empathy with the user and to prioritize key features and design decisions based on real user data.

Wireframes and Prototypes
Once the steps in the user journey have been mapped out, the UX designer can start to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that is intuitive and easy for the user to navigate. This is where wireframes and prototypes come in.

A wireframe is like a blueprint, demonstrating the layout of the design and how it will function. A prototype is essentially a scaled-down version of the final product—a simulation or sample version which allows you to test your ideas and designs before you get them developed. Wireframes and prototypes tend to start off as rather basic, low-fidelity sketches, and then, based on feedback and initial testing, will evolve into detailed mock-ups that closely resemble the final design.

User Testing
Testing is a fundamental part of the UX designer’s job and a core component of the overall UX design process. Just like user research, it is important to test your designs on real users; this way, you get authentic feedback from those who will actually be using the product. Testing also makes sense from a business perspective— a UX designer can catch any major design flaws before going into the development phase, which saves considerable time and money for the company.
The most common type of testing for UX designers is usability testing, which is a technique used to evaluate how intuitive and user-friendly a particular design is. After a few rounds of testing, the UX designer uses the results to improve the design, adjust the prototypes, and test again. This process of continuous testing and improvement is known as iteration.

How UX Designers and UI Designers Work Together
It is important to note that visual design does not typically come under the UX design process; that is the role of the user interface (UI) designer. So, once the UX designer has taken care of the layout and information architecture, the UI designer steps in to handle the aesthetics.

UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.

Design to Development Hand-Off
Regardless of the scope of a project, the UI designer works closely with developers to reach the end goal. As a UX designer, it is important to maintain a good relationship with the development team—they are the ones who will bring your designs to life and turn them into functional products, after all, the UI designer tries to be as thorough as possible when documenting the entire UX design process, and aim to have regular check-ins with the development team. The earlier you involve the developers, the sooner you can identify any design elements that might be tricky to implement from a technical perspective.

UX Design Quadrant Model
On top of the foundational UX design skills (like prototyping, user empathy, and user testing), many UX designers also choose to specialize in one or two areas depending on their interests, skills, and the needs of their employer.
A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the lens of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:
•	Experience Strategy (ExS)
•	User Research (UR)
•	Information Architecture (IA)
•	Interaction Design (IxD)

While UX designers tend to be well-versed in all of the above fields, most will only choose to focus on one or two in their careers. These quadrant principles are explained in detail below.
Experience Strategy (ExS)
UX design is not just about the user; it also brings huge value to the business providing the product or service. Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.

If you choose to focus on experience strategy, you might find yourself in the role of UX strategist. UX strategists work closely with both the design team and key business stakeholders (product owners, managers, etc.); it is their job to make sure that everyone is serving the right users while simultaneously aligning with the strategic goals of the business. In short, UX strategists see to it that all the moving parts of a business work together in harmony.
User Research (UR)

User research is a crucial component of the UX design process. Indeed, all UX designers must master the art of user research—and some will even choose to specialize in this area.

As the job title suggests, UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users. As a UX research specialist, you can expect to work closely with the product team to identify research questions, plan and lead user research sessions (such as interviews, surveys, usability tests, etc.), and share your insights in order to inform the product strategy. Some additional roles often associated with the user research quadrant include Usability Analyst and Research Analyst.
Information Architecture (IA)

This is the science of organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly way. If you are designing a website or app, the information architecture has a huge impact on how easy it is to navigate—so, as a UX designer, you will need to understand the principles of IA.

If you decide to specialize in this aspect of UX, you could end up working as an information architect. Information architecture has roots in both cognitive psychology and library science—you can think of information architects as user-centric digital librarians. As an information architect, you may be responsible for assessing the IA of an existing product, planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labeling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies.

Interaction Design
Interaction design focuses on how a user interacts with specific elements of a digital product. This quadrant looks at the structure and behavior of interactive systems, and how they can be designed and optimized for human use.
Interaction designers answer questions such as what happens when a user clicks a button or how will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app. Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.
Other Specialist Career Paths for UX designers
UX design is an ever-growing field, offering plenty of opportunities to both specialize and diversify.
 
UX writer
Written copy plays a crucial part in the overall user experience, and just like all the visual touchpoints, the words on the product interface also need to be designed. Dedicated UX writers are increasingly sought-after, and this is a great potential career path if you want to combine copywriting with UX.

Voice Designer
The global voice and speech recognition market is estimated to be worth a whopping $31.82 billion by 2025—meaning that voice designers are in high demand. Voice designers apply UX principles in order to create user-friendly interactions with voice technology. They conduct research, create personas and placeonas, define the information architecture, and design user flows scripts, and dialogs. 

UX Developer
Traditionally, designers and developers belong to two very separate camps. These days, however, more and more designers are choosing to pick up some front-end coding skills and become so-called UX developers. A UX developer is best described as a part designer and part-developer, and the role generally involves some visual design skills, too.

Most Important Soft Skills for UX Designers
Soft skills are a combination of personal attributes and social and communication skills. They are harder to measure than technical skills but are increasingly valued in the workplace. As a UX designer, you will often work on cross-team and cross-functional products; this is where soft skills can make the most impact. 
Communication

UX designers spend a great deal of time presenting to clients and stakeholders, interviewing users, and collaborating with developers and fellow designers. So, the number one skill to have as a UX designer is communication—and it goes both ways. Whether written, verbal, or visual, UX designers need to be able to articulate their ideas clearly while also being active and engaged listeners.

Empathy
Empathy is at the heart of user-centric design. Whenever decisions are made about the direction of a product or service, it is the role of a UX designer to advocate for the users. You need to step into the user’s shoes and view the product through their eyes. What are their pain points, what are their goals, and What do they want to achieve when using the product? Empathy will allow you and anyone else you are working with to make better design decisions, so it should be incorporated into your design process from the very beginning. 

Organization
UX designers work with a great many documents and design deliverables—from design briefs, research findings, and interview results, to wireframes, prototypes, and design specifications. UX designers, therefore, need to be extremely organized; not just for their own efficiency, but for the rest of the team, too. Nearly all of their work is eventually distributed to other team members and stakeholders. As a UX designer, you will have a very varied workload, so you will need to stay organized and on top of things.
