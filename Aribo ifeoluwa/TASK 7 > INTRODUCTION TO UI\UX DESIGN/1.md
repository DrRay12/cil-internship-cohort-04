1. Your mission for today is to start browsing websites and apps you use frequently and to make a note of anything that you find intuitive or frustrating. 
    - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) :Its content is well sectionalized
   - [Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/) : It is quite difficult for users with no technical skills (HTML) to upload contents and comments.

2. For today’s task, we want to turn the focus back to you. Think about the UX design process — do any of the functions or tasks that we discussed resemble anything you do in your current job? If so, write down what they are and how they’re similar to the UX design process.
   - **User Research:** Every process of writing codes begins with a research to identify a problem and work towards it.
   - **User Testing:** After developing an app it is quite a norm to test out the app to identify bugs and flaws before it gets to production phase.

3. Your mission today is to identify some key UX influencers and try to categorize them into one or two of the quadrants. Where do their strengths and interests appear to lie? Do they match a particular job title?

4. Let’s imagine you’re a newly qualified UX designer and have just started your first job in the field. Someone asks you what you do, but when you say “UX design”, they look rather confused. How would you explain to them what UX design is and what your role entails? Think about the following:
What is UX design?, What does a UX designer actually do?, How is UX design different to other design fields?
    - As a UX designer, I make  create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users and  make a product or service usable, enjoyable, and accessible.
    
5. For today’s tutorial, we’re sending you on a mission for inspiration! Browse the internet and find two or three portfolios that catch your eye. For each portfolio, identify three things that you think the designer does well, and why. At the same time, look out for some aspects that could be improved. Pay attention to the “About me” sections, the overall usability of each portfolio, and most importantly, how they present their case studies. Do they document their process thoroughly? How do they demonstrate their approach to problem solving? How could they present a stronger narrative?
 - [Brittany Chiang](https://www.brittanychiang.com/) I really like the simplicity and coolness because of the theme and fonts and also the color choice.
 - [Sarah Chang](https://www.brittanychiang.com/) It's well detailed and explainatory.

## **Fundamentals of UI and UX**

## What is UI Design?

UI design is the process of making interfaces in software or computerized devices with a focus on looks or style. Designers aim to create designs users will find easy to use and pleasurable.

The goal of user interface design is to make the user’s interaction as simple and efficient as possible. 

## Why is UI design important? 

User interface design is important because it can make or break your customer base. It can be the difference between a successful app/website and one that fails. It can also mean the difference between customers staying on your site or leaving it.

The user interface (UI) design is the actual look and feel of the website. It’s what you see on the screen and interact with. You can think of it as the website’s “skin”. The UI includes colors, typography, page layouts, buttons, and other visual elements that are used in web design.

It’s crucial to have a beautiful and consistent UI to create an enjoyable user experience (UX).


## What is UX Design?

UX designers are tasked with shaping the overall user experience of a website or web application, focusing on how it feels, functions, and looks.

In other words, good UX design is all about making sure that a visitor to your site has a good experience when they’re there.

User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.

UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience design encompasses traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.

User experience design consists of traditional elements of design and engineering integrated with scientific disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology. UX designers are responsible for the overall feel of a product or service.

## Why is UX design important? 

In the case of a website, UX design includes everything from aesthetics to whether or not a site is usable, and it plays a vital role in your company’s success. Customers who have positive experiences are likely to return, while those who don’t can form negative opinions of your brand that they’ll share with others.

In the case of a product, UX designers are responsible for the user experience (UX) of a product. Their job is to ensure that the product logically flows from one step to the next. UX designers solve for usability first and aesthetics second.

| Focuses on making sure each screen looks its best visually and serves its purpose in an overall product. | They’re concerned with optimizing the flow of information – how easy it is for users to get from point A to point B. |

## Conclusion

UI and UX work together but are different. UX design is more analytical. It’s rooted in cognitive behaviour and human psychology. UI design software is focused more on the visuals—or whether a product is aesthetically pleasing.

*UX is more to do with the actual functionality and content of a website or app, while UI is the look and feel and how people interact with it.*
