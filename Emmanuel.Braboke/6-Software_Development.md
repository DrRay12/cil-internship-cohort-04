## Scrum 
Scrum methodology is a sprint-based project management approach with the objective of providing stakeholders with the greatest possible value. It's an incremental development-based approach to project management. Each iteration consists of two to four-week sprints, with the aim of completing the most crucial features first and producing a potentially marketable product at the end of each sprint. Following sprints, further features are added to the product, and between-sprint adjustments are made based on stakeholder and consumer input.

### Benefits of Scrum
- Flexibility and adaptability
  Scrum is suitable for a wide range of environments and situations where there are no clearly defined requirements and a flexible approach is required
- Creativity and innovation
  Creativity is encouraged and new ideas are likely to emerge when Scrum teams collaborate and analyze ideas from all of their members.
- Lower costs
An organization can save money by implementing the Scrum method since it typically requires less documentation and control.
- Customer satisfaction
 The team may produce successful products and solutions if everyone works to the best of their abilities and makes regular adjustments in response to internal and external feedback
