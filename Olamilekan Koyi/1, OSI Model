Question
Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the osi model


Answer


Without further ado, let’s understand what the osi model is, 
The osi model also known as the first standard model for network communications was adopted in the early 1980’s,
it’s an acronym for “open systems interconnection model” describes the seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network,
they include 
application layer, presentation layer, session layer all grouped together to form the ‘software layers’ transport layer also known as the heart of OSI ,
network layer, data link layer and physical layer which can grouped together to be called ‘hardware layers’

Now that has been established, let’s talk about ‘transmission protocol control/the internet protocol’ suite aka TCP/IP, 
this is a four layered suite of communication protocols which are also used to allow computers communicate over a network, 
the most notable difference between the osi and tcp model is that the osi model consists of seven (7) layers while the tcp model consists of four (4) layers
The major advantage the tcp model has over the osi model is that it provides connectionless transmission in the network layer,
supports connecting and connectionless oriented transmission in the transport layer while the osi model permits only connection oriented transmission in the transport layer, 
which in turn makes the tcp model simpler in comparison to the osi model.
