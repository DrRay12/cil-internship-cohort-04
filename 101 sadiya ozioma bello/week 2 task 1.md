Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

TCP/IP Model
Like the OSI model, the TCP/IP model is layered and is used in the same fashion as the OSI model but with fewer layers. As the modern Internet and most communications use the Internet Protocol (IP), the TCP/IP model is technically more in line with modern network implementations. As stated the layers within the TCP/IP model are considered less rigid than that of the OSI model, which basically means that many protocols implemented can be considered in gray areas between one area and another. The TCP/IP protocol suite (often referred to as the TCP/IP protocol) contains the same protocols referenced in the OSI model 

The Link Layer
The link layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model; it is also referred to in some texts as the network interface layer. The link layer combines the physical and data link layer functions into a single layer. This includes frame physical network functions like modulation, line coding and bit synchronization, frame synchronization and error detection, and LLC and MAC sub layer functions. Common protocols include the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11.


The Internet Layer
The Internet layer is the next layer up from the link layer and is associated with the network layer of the OSI model. Functions include traffic routing, traffic control, fragmentation, and logical addressing. Common protocols include IP, ICMP and IGMP.
The Transport Layer
The Transport layer is the next layer and is typically related directly with the same named layer in the OSI model. Functions include message segmentation, acknowledgement, traffic control, session multiplexing, error detection and correction (resend), and message reordering. Common protocols include the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and User Data gram Protocol (UDP).
The Application Layer
The Application layer is the highest layer in the TCP/IP model and is related to the session, presentation and application layers of the OSI model. The application layer of the TCP/IP model is used to handle all process-to-process communication functions; these functions were carried out by multiple different layers when referencing the OSI model. There are a number of different functions which are carried out by this layer, including session establishment, maintenance and termination, character code translations, data conversion, compression and encryption, remote access, network management and electronic messaging to name a few. Common protocols include Named Pipes, Net-BIOS, MIME, TLS, SSL, FTP, DNS, HTTP, SMTP and many others.
Summary
In conclusion, the OSI model and the TCP/IP model are very similar in layers. It is just that, the OSI model are seven(7) layer while the TCP/IP model are four(4). The TCP/IP model is less rigid to that of OSI model.
