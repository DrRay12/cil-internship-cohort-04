Scrum can be defined as a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Simply, it could mean a methodology that helps efficiently develop and deliver productions.
The main idea behind Scrum is that the process of product development is broken up
into relatively short and fixed-duration iterations called sprints during which a team
creates one piece of software (an increment) that is potentially releasable. A distinctive feature of this framework is that there is no heavy planning at the
beginning and a Scrum team can start coding once it receives enough information to
complete the first incremental release. After the first increment is built, a team tests and
reviews it to make this specific piece of software ready for delivery. Hence, at the end of
the sprint, a client receives a potentially shippable feature set. The same procedure
(planning → building → testing → reviewing = increment) is repeated for all future
sprints until a product is complete.
SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF SCRUM ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. One of the reasons scrum is used on projects is that it allows for delivering more value to clients in a myriad of ways. Some of its advantages are listed below; 1. Quick start; Scrum assumes incremental development where the programmers just get to work without having to wait for the development team. One wouldn’t have to wait for a long time before the first increment is completed. 2. Frequent releases; With the scrum methodology, project sprints are done quickly. One wouldn’t have to wait for a month or two. 3. Transparency: In the scrum methodology, clients are actively involved in the process, they don’t just get to see the final products alone. 4. Budget forecast: Due to the fact that projects are worked on based on iterations, this avoids unnecessary spending. Projects that don’t meet the client's expectations would have been terminated. 2. From agile manifestos; Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to changes over following a plan
