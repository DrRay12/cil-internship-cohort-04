# Fundamentals of UI/UX

### Introduction

UI/UX Design is essential in the creation of digital products it is user-centered and ensures that products solve real-world problems while being straightforward, intuitive and enjoyable to use. While being similar fields, UI design and UX design perform different processes.

### What is UI Design?
According to the Interaction Design Foundation, User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Good UI is a challenge to create as it should be seamless, intuitive and be transparent; in the sense that users shouldn’t focus on it but rather, the task at hand.
User interface design is responsible for a huge part of the overall look and feel a user experiences while interacting with a design. 

### What is UX Design?
User Experience Design is a field that is concerned with the overall functionality, seamlessness, usability and user-adaptability of a product. The term "design" is sometimes used to refer to aesthetics and visual assets, but its actual meaning is more related to the process of creating product that offer a smooth user experience.
The effects of good & bad UX are undeniably critical to a product’s success and lifeline which is why it is important for a UX designer to understand the target audience and how to create an enjoyable experience for them.

### Differences between UI and UX
Despite the terms being used interchangeably, UI design and UX design deal with separate roles and processes. As the CEO of Foster.fm puts it,
“User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto a canvas without thought, while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.”
In essence, User Experience Design is concerned with the user’s journey to solve a problem while User Interface Design pays attention to the visual aesthetics of a product.

### Importance of UI/UX Design
UI/UX designers help communicate brand values and reinforce users’ trust through design; high-quality UX UI design will help increase conversion rates and maximize customer retention. 

### Conclusion
Having excellent UI/UX Design in a product is essential. Your whole interaction with a product is shaped by the union of UX and UI. Even if two similar products could provide you the same outcome in the end, how they present it is reflected in their UX/UI. People will use a product more frequently because they like the entire experience if it has superior UX/UI design than the competition.
