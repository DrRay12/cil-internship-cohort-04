# SCRUM

### What is scrum?

Scrum finds its origins from a rughby strategy where all the players pack themselves closely with their heads down with the goal of obtainning possession of the ball

In software development scrum is a strategy used in product development similar to its rugby origin in the sense that it involves a team of software developers coming together to put their heads down (thinking) to address project problems like how to approach the project at hand, what features to work on, set deadlines for features etc and carry out actions to achieve a goal in a process called sprints then reiterating till the project deadline or budget is spent. This allows for rapid development and testing, especially within a small team.

The scrum process involves the participation of the scrum master, the scrum team, and the product owners
* **Product owner:** The product owner is responsible for what the team builds, and why they build it. The product owner is responsible for keeping the backlog of work up to date and in priority order.

* **Scrum master:** They are part of the Scrum team, they ensures that the Scrum process is followed by the team. Scrum masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments and other blocking issues that arise during the sprint.

* **Scrum team:** The members of the Scrum team actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.

### what are the benefits of scrum?

* Developers get freedom to make decisions on features a product needs to meet the shareholders wants, giving room for high morale of the developers and ownership of the products as the features they are developing are their own idea

* It encourages teamwork commitment, focus, openness and respect within a development team.

* it allows for early release of the products even if all features aren't ready so it can be tested in the market if the market finds it useful or necessary and if not it allows such feature to be refactored for it to find a market fit.

* The feature by feature process to product completion reduces the time for the product release to market because rather than having to build all features and test before releasing, the release as you build process allows for fasters testing and tracking of what has been done.

* it usually leads to a faster retun of interest due to the speed with which testing with market needs is done and reduced time in shipping features and products


# Agile manifesto

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
