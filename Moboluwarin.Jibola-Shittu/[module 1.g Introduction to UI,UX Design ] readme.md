<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 2 </h1>

# UI/UX Fundamentals

## UX Design
User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating!

You’ll often hear about UX in relation to digital products, such as websites and apps—but UX isn’t limited to the digital space. Anything that can be experienced can be designed, from the packaging of a toothbrush to the wheels of an orthopaedic chair.

The impact of good (and bad!) UX is everywhere. That’s one of the reasons it’s such an exciting field, and also explains why you already know a lot more about UX than you realize. Every time you curse a push door that has a pull bar, or close a confusing website in frustration, you’re making a judgement on the quality of its UX design.

## UI Design
User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.

User Interface (UI) Design is the link between users and your website. It includes the basic design elements that need to be present in order to for someone to navigate your site and make decisions. It is the ever-evolving relationship between a person and the system that they are using. It includes the way that your website interacts with users, the overall design and how information is presented. There are many different ways that you can look at user interface, but the basics always include the communication from a product to the user and vice versa. UI Design is all about structure, user manipulation and communication. This is one of the reasons it’s so important that you pay close attention to it. It is the basic building blocks of how your website is set up and functions when visited by your target audience. If it doesn’t go smoothly, problems tend to follow. Some of the elements involved in User Interface Design include the input controls, navigational components, informational components and containers. 

### Benefits of UI Design and UX Design:
- Retain Users for a Long Time
When effectively curated, your user design increases repeat sales. An interface with a great layout and easy to navigate will attract loyal customers who want to go with you to the digital experience.
You’ll experience low bounce rates and high brand loyalty. A good example is Facebook which has nurtured interactions, a great UI, and feature upgrades to achieve a 5% increase in daily active users who log in every day.
- Attracts New Customers on the Platform
By attending to the needs of consumers, you’ll be attracting more prospects who’ll want to convert. With outstanding UI/UX, the right approach will pique customer interest and eventually lead to fruitful conversions.
- Increases Productivity
A streamlined website with an intuitive UI/UX design can raise your ROI by creating a smooth workflow for employees. Your employees will enjoy seamless experiences working on pertinent matters without distractions, ensuring high productivity rates.
- Increases Conversion Rates of Your Platform
A good UI/UX design will encourage customers to return to your site for more. They’ll love the experience, stay on for longer and come more often to shop. With time they’ll recommend your business to friends and boost conversion rates for your platform.
Additionally, UI/UX of your landing pages also plays a major role in boosting conversion rates of your website. Your landing page is the first impression of your website. The more time your customers spend on it, the higher chance they’ll convert into buyers.
- Best Experience for All Devices
UI/UX design offers optimal experiences on all devices, including PCs, smartphones, and tablets. That’s who you should ensure it’s optimized to offer seamless browsing experiences for mobile users. Uniformity across platforms will help you tap into a broader audience base, increasing your overall bottom line.
- Improved Website Speed
Impressive UX and UI may increase your site’s load speed. And the site’s load time can have a massive impact on your revenue. Boosting a site’s load time by only 0.1% can increase conversions by 10% for travel websites and 8% for retail websites.
And how does a slow-loading website impact customers? Most users won’t make a purchase, return to the site, or even recommend it to their peers.
- Interaction Acknowledgment
A quality UI or UX design offers interactive experiences to customers when browsing, downloading, purchasing, or performing any action on your website.
For instance, instead of adding static CTA buttons, make the buttons change color when someone presses them to show the completion of the action.
- Improves Customer Satisfaction
A well-crafted UI/UX design offers smooth navigation and ease of use. Your customers will enjoy fast experiences that enhance their satisfaction with your site, products, and brand. A satisfied consumer is a loyal customer who will help you market your products to others.
- Save Time and Money
Both customers and prospects come to your website to get information or purchase products. With a UI/UX design done right, you’ll not spend any time and money on customer support. Why? Customers will not run into any issues that warrant help from customer support.
- Get Your Competitors’ Customers
UX is a competitive differentiator. Most customers expect a fantastic user experience from brands, anyways. And if they find a slow-loading website or one that’s difficult to navigate, they’ll check out a similar site.

Question 4
Differentiate Bad UX from good UX

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 4 </h1>

Differentiate between ‘Good UX’ and ‘Bad UX’
- A good UX design makes the usage of the product intuitive while a bad UX design might make the usage of the product seem overcomplicated and frustrating.
- A good UX design uses notations or features that users can easily understand, and take action on, whereas a bad UX design may use highly technical jargon that only experts may understand. 
- Pairing thoughtful experience design with clear, hierarchical visual design will create a good UX design whereas ignoring visual design can lead to bad UX experiences.
- A good UX design not only informs a user when an error has occurred, but it also actively designs to prevent errors from happening in the first place.
- Errors are inevitable, however, when it happens, a good UX design would inform users about it. However, you need to be careful of language, tone and design. Leaning on technical language, or database error terms will lead to a bad user experience.
- In a good example of UX design, the users are informed about what is happening on the page in a reasonable response time following the action. Whereas, if the page doesn’t provide timely feedback as to what’s happening on the page, it may create a more negative or confusing experience and is a classic example of bad UX design. 
- A good UX design provides a palatable experience for the user while a bad UX design comes with frustrations or dissatisfaction.

Question 5
Problem Solving using UX design

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 5 </h1>


Useful guidelines to problem-solving using UX design:
- Do not define the problem immediately. Listen to your users. Gather as many information first by getting some context on what their perceived problems are in the process. It is easy to get distracted by the different problems they will share with you. We don’t want to create many solutions to their many problems. As much as possible, we want a solution that fits all their common problems.
- Define the “real” problem. After you have gathered enough information, you can now define what the real problem is. The underlying insights on what they believe is their problem. This way, you are solving their common problems with one novel solution. You are helping your team develop the features based on insightful design process.
- Start with low-fidelity to high-fidelity wireframes. It is better to start with pen and paper sketches because it gives a sense that it is still an ongoing brainstorming process. Once you have made the right approach, move forward with producing high-fidelity such as mockups or prototypes. Choosing which as an output depends on the team and the capacity. Explore different tools that make your thinking process more effective.
- Show it to your users. Show it to a few users and get their feedback. A walkthrough is helpful. Use different methods to user test your designs. Never stick to only one approach or you’ll miss getting feedback from other users outside your comfort zone.
- Iterate. It is important for you to accept criticism. The goal of the designer is to arrive at the best solution that most of your users understand. The only way to achieve that is to show it to your users, gather as many feedback, suggestions as possible direct to your users.
Developing your problem-solving skills in design takes time so always practice, improve and explore different ways. When you are armed with different tools under your belt, exploring design solutions is a worthwhile activity to improve as a designer.

Question 6
Know the different areas of UX (career-wise)

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 6 </h1>

Different areas of UX(career-wise)
- UX Designer
This is the obvious career option for students with a degree in UX design. Why do car manufacturers need UX designers? To assure that cars being sold to the public are enjoyable and easy to use. Why do websites need UX designers? To assure users have the optimum experience while visiting a site.
UX designers are ultimately relied upon to improve the “feel” of a product or website. You must be able to tap into users’ emotions and identify what their needs are when they seek out a specific product. Your objective is to create a compelling experience for consumers based on research and analysis. Some of your roles involve consulting with clients to better understand their goals for a product, creating product designs and prototypes, developing personas and analyzing user feedback.
- Interaction Designer
Interaction designers are "responsible for creating efficient and effective interactions between users and interfaces (screens)." For instance, an interaction designer would ensure that a website presents navigation options in a way that flows and that is easy for the user to decipher. 
- Visual Designer
Visual designers create the concept, artwork and layout for digital projects based on the client’s vision of the final product and the prototype they’ve been given. Developing engaging, effective and user-friendly visual design solutions are the goal in this role.
If you choose this path, you will need to understand how to establish the overall look and feel of interfaces like websites, mobile apps and games. Time management is a key skill to possess when entering visual design so that you can ensure timely production on all projects.
- Information Architect
As an information architect, you will be responsible for scoping, constructing and optimizing website content as it appears to users. You must learn to develop realistic user experience plans intended to meet the goals set by an organization. Your main focus will be the target audience and the technology used to create the website and website content.
You will be expected to produce workflow diagrams and organize data into site maps. Information architects work with web developers and creative teams to implement design tactics.
- UX Writer
Are you interested in copywriting and user experience? If so, landing a career as a UX writer could be a great option for you. UX writers focus on "creating important information such as text in buttons and forms understandable by the intended audience groups."
- Product Designer
If you are a person with a creative eye for shapes, colors and overall visual appeal, product design could fit your skill set perfectly. Project designer is currently one of the most common and broad job titles in the UX design industry. People in this field are often required to possess skills present in other design positions.
The job involves designing products we use in our day-to-day lives and constantly improving how the product looks and functions to minimize cost. Designers may also be asked conduct research and pitch brand new product ideas based off client analyses.
- User Researcher
A user researcher is responsible for exploring trends in the market, conducting studies with users to find out more about user behavior and presenting these findings to other UX professionals. User researchers "come up with personas and scenarios which would help the designers understand their usage and interaction with the products."
- Web Marketer
Maybe a career focus in design isn’t where you want to go, and you want to move away from the technical side of user experience. Internet marketing is one route you can take, which doesn’t necessarily require design experience, but is a field where your design background will definitely help you stand out.
Since you’re already familiar with how users interact through digital communication, you should pick up on the fundamentals of web marketing in no time.
- Project Manager
If you’re interested in working behind the scenes in a design role that allows you to grow a project from start to finish, project management could be the right career path for you. This position is essential in a design environment. You have the opportunity to plan, budget, oversee and document every part of your assigned project.
Project managers work to ensure efficient execution of projects. The areas you work in can range from technical/IT, to human resources, to construction and more. You might be asked to assemble a team of professionals to bring together materials, organize quality control and continuously track progress of a design plan. A project manager’s skills are adaptable in many industries, so you’re not restricted only to UX and web design.

Question 7
Laws of UX

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 7 </h1>

## Some Laws of UX
- Hick’s Law
Hick’s Law states that users spend more time making a decision based on the number and complexity of choices.
The more choices you present your users with, the longer it will take them to reach a decision.
- Fitts’ Law
Drawing from Fitts’ Law, UX designers can begin to predict human behavior and movement. Fitts’ Law says that “the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.” Essentially, Using Fitt’s Law as a foundation, UX designers can create ergonomically designed experiences that help reduce human error, increase user productivity, foster safety, and ultimately, lead to user satisfaction.
- Jakob’s Law
Jakob’s Law was coined by Jakob Nielsen, a principal of the Nielsen Norman Group. He states the idea that since users spend time on other sites or applications, they have an expectation that your site or app will function in the same way. Because users spend most of their time on other sites, they expect your site to work in the same way as other sites they’ve already visited.
With that in mind, designers need to focus on using patterns and conventions that their users are accustom to. This can be in areas such as workflows, page navigation, structure, and placement of common elements. This prevents users from feeling overwhelmed by learning a new mental model or process, and instead, empowers them to keep engaging with your interface.
- Miller’s Law
Miller’s Law was formulated by George A. Miller, an American psychologist who was one of the founders of cognitive psychology, and it states that the average person can only keep seven (plus or minus two) items in their working memory. Humans can only hold about seven pieces of information in their memory at a time. More than that and they could be overwhelmed.
- Parkinson’s Law
Parkinson’s Law states that work will keep expanding to fill up the available time for completion. People will keep working on a task until their allotted time is reached.
