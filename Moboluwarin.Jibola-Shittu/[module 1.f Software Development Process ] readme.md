Question 1
Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 1 </h1>

Scrum is an agile development methodology used in the development of Software based on an iterative and incremental processes.  Scrum is adaptable, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project. The primary objective of Scrum is to satisfy the customer’s need through an environment of transparency in communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress. The development starts from a general idea of what needs to be built, elaborating a list of characteristics ordered by priority (product backlog) that the owner of the product wants to obtain. Scrum is a hands-on agile methodology consisting of simple interlocking steps and components. It is a framework for project management. The processes involved in Scrum are described below.

- A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.
- The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
- The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.
- The Scrum Master keeps the team focused on the goal.
- At the sprint’s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint. 

### Different Roles in Scrum
In Scrum, the team focuses on building quality software. The owner of a Scrum project focuses on defining what are the characteristics that the product must have to build (what to build, what not and in what order) and to overcome any obstacle that could hinder the task of the development team.

##### The Scrum team consists of the following roles:
- Scrum master: The person who leads the team guiding them to comply with the rules and processes of the methodology. Scrum master manages the reduction of impediments of the project and works with the Product Owner to maximize the ROI. The Scrum Master is in charge of keeping Scrum up to date, providing coaching, mentoring and training to the teams in case it needs it.
- Product owner (PO): Is the representative of the stakeholders and customers who use the software. They focus on the business part and is responsible for the ROI of the project. They translate the vision of the project to the team, validate the benefits in stories to be incorporated into the Product Backlog and prioritize them on a regular basis.
- Team: A group of professionals with the necessary technical knowledge who develop the project jointly carrying out the stories they commit to at the start of each sprint.

##### Benefits of Scrum
The benefits of Agile are tied directly to its faster, lighter, more engaged mindset. The process, in a nutshell, delivers what the customer wants, when the customer wants it. There’s much less wasted time spent developing in the wrong direction, and the entire system is quicker to respond to changes.

- Stakeholder Engagement: Agile provides multiple opportunities for stakeholder and team engagement – before, during, and after each Sprint. By involving the client in every step of the project, there is a high degree of collaboration between the client and project team, providing more opportunities for the team to truly understand the client’s vision. Delivering working software early and frequently increases stakeholders’ trust in the team’s ability to deliver high-quality working software and encourages them to be more deeply engaged in the project.
- Transparency: An Agile approach provides a unique opportunity for clients to be involved throughout the project, from prioritizing features to iteration planning and review sessions to frequent software builds containing new features. However, this also requires clients to understand that they are seeing a work in progress in exchange for this added benefit of transparency.
- Early and Predictable Delivery: By using time-boxed, fixed schedule Sprints of 1-4 weeks, new features are delivered quickly and frequently, with a high level of predictability. This also provides the opportunity to release or beta test the software earlier than planned if there is sufficient business value.
- Predictable Costs and Schedule: Because each Sprint is a fixed duration, the cost is predictable and limited to the amount of work that can be performed by the team in the fixed-schedule time box. Combined with the estimates provided to the client prior to each Sprint, the client can more readily understand the approximate cost of each feature, which improves decision making about the priority of features and the need for additional iterations.
- Allows for Change: While the team needs to stay focused on delivering an agreed-to subset of the product’s features during each iteration, there is an opportunity to constantly refine and reprioritize the overall product backlog. New or changed backlog items can be planned for the next iteration, providing the opportunity to introduce changes within a few weeks.
- Focuses on Business Value: By allowing the client to determine the priority of features, the team understands what’s most important to the client’s business, and can deliver the features that provide the most business value.
- Focuses on Users: Agile commonly uses user stories with business-focused acceptance criteria to define product features. By focusing features on the needs of real users, each feature incrementally delivers value, not just an IT component. This also provides the opportunity to beta test software after each Sprint, gaining valuable feedback early in the project and providing the ability to make changes as needed.
- Improves Quality: By breaking down the project into manageable units, the project team can focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. Also, by producing frequent builds and conducting testing and reviews during each iteration, quality is improved by finding and fixing defects quickly and identifying expectation mismatches early





Question 2

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Answer 2 </h1>

Individuals and interactions *over processes and tools*
Working software over *comprehensive documentation*
Customer collaboration *over contract negotiation*
Responding to change over *following a plan*.
