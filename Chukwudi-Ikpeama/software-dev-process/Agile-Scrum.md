# Scrum

***Scrum*** is a lightweigth project management framework that helps people, 
teams and organizations solve complex software development problems with 
emphasis on teamwork, accountability, incremental and iterative process. It is a subeset 
of Agile Methodology

## Benefits of Scrum in Software development

### 1. Fast Delivery
A well defined sprint ensures a predictable increment. Because the product owner is part of 
the scrum team, there is quick resolution of problems, and requirements can be delivered as 
they are needed. 


### 2. Improves Team Morale
Developers have the ability to make decisions and take full ownership of their work, this helps improves the general morale in a scrum team.

### 3. Adaptability and Flexibility
In situations where the scope and requirements are not clearly defined, future changes in requirement 
can be quickly integrated into the project without affecting project output.

### 4. Improves Customers Satisfaction
 Clients can test the product at the end of each sprint and communicate their feedback to the team. 
 Since Scrum is designed for adaptability, changes can be made quickly and easily. This ensures 
 delivery of quality work that meets customers satisfaction.

### 5. Cost Effectiveness
Scrum can be cost-effective for organizations as it decreases delivery time through early and regular 
feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
