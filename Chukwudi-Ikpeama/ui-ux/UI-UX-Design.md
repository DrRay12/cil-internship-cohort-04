# UI / UX Fundamentals
User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field.
While UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, UI design is all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.
A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are typically essential for the product’s success.


### UI Design
User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. 
UI design aims at creating interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. 


### UX Design
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. 
UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

## The five main principles of UX design
The principles of UX design can be broken down into five main concepts: Empathy, Strategy, Usability, Inclusivity, and Validation.

### Empathy
Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the front and center of a product development. 
This involves understanding the user and what obstacles they face while using the product.
UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, 
what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.

### Strategy
A crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. 
UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives includes chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, 
and what success looks like for both the user and the business. UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

### Usability
Consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. 
To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.

### Inclusivity
A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. 
UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals

## UX Design Process

### Empathize
Empathy is key—and user research is essential to finding that understanding and connection to your users’ needs and goals. 
So the first step is to conduct extensive  and inclusive research about the people who will be interacting with the product. 

### Define
After they’ve come to understand their users needs and goals, UX designers figure out and define what problems need solving, and set direct guidelines for the tasks ahead.
Here UX designers get a clear idea of the project requirements, and what the goals for the business are. Once designers have a comprehensive idea of their users, they’ll present their findings in the form of a user persona—an archetypical person that represents the needs and behaviors of the larger population. They may also come up with a user journey map to visually represent the ideal customer experience.

### Ideate
This stage often happens recursively throughout the defining, prototyping, and even testing stages—you discover user needs and your imagination starts coming up with ways to solve those problems! 
But skilled UX designers also know how to come up with ideas in systematic ways. There are also a wide variety of design thinking exercises that help UX designers (and the people they collaborate with) to generate innovative and delightful solutions to design problems.

### Prototype
This is the phase that most people think of when it comes to UX design as it involves the actual creation of the product or service. Designers create mockups and prototypes to initially test their ideas to make sure they’ll actually work as intended. Afterwards, UX designers create wireframes to ensure that the ideas are translated well from design to development.

### Test
No UX design process is complete without testing your design solutions to ensure that they’ll actually work the way you intend! So, now that a design has been created, it’s time to test that design against actual users with usability testing. Designers will observe their users interact with their designs and ask them to complete certain tasks. They take note of the user’s emotions, body language, statements, frustrations, and difficulties they have when using the product. After testing, designers compile the data, analyze it, and determine what improvements need to be made.

### Then…iterate!
The UX design process is a cyclical one meaning that once the designs have been created and user feedback has been obtained, it’s time to repeat the steps again. With each cycle of the design process, 
designers take what they’ve learned from previous ones and address new problems, make meaningful improvements, and design more effective solutions. Even after product release, designers will continue to obtain user feedback and iterate upon their original designs.
