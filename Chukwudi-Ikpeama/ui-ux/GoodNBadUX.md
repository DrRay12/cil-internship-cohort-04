# Apps with Good and Bad UX 


## Frustrating UX

### Twitter Mobile App
There is home button when viewing tweets. So when you are deep into a tweet tree (sub-comments), 
you will need to tap the back button several times before getting to the home screen.

### Access More (Access Bank Mobile App)
When you have several account, there is no intuitive way to switch accounts. There is no indication to know that you will need to swipe left or right to switch from the current account on dispaly to another.

## Good UX

### YouTube
The video preview feature of youtube gives an insight about the video to users.
