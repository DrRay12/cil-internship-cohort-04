# Q. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development
Scrum is a software product development framework that helps teams work together. it encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working 
on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve. 

It works as a light-weight agile process tool that splits your organization into small,cross-functional and self-organizing teams. It allows teams to build smaller and 
faster, easily adjust or make changes, constantly communicate and incorporate feedback in the development process, this abandons the risk of spending months or years on a 
process that ultimately fails because of some small mistake in an early phase. It relies instead on trusting employees and teams to work directly with customers to 
understand the goals and provide solutions in a fast and incremental way. 

In Scrum, time is split into short fixed-length iterations or sprints (usually 2-4 weeks) with potentially shippable code delivered after each iteration. The team meets 
daily to discuss progress and also at the end of the iteration to review the previous sprint. 

## How Scrum Works
* Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features (a product backlog). The team meets to discuss:
The backlog,
What still needs to be completed,
How long it will take.

The product backlog is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, the team’s 
“To Do” list. The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because requirements change, items may no longer be 
relevant or problems may get solved in other ways. Features in the backlog are described in terms of user stories or bug fixes, the scrum team estimates the work to be 
done associated with each story and features are ranked in order of importance.

* Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints: sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done. Top priority items from 
the product backlog are added to the sprint backlog and these items are to be completed at the end of each sprint. A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to 
complete an item from the sprint backlog. The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product and each sprint ends with a sprint review. Then the team chooses 
another piece of the product backlog to develop — which starts a new sprint. Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.

* In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans for that day.
The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes,
Each team member needs to be present and prepared,
The scrum master keeps the team focused on the goal.

The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours. The stand up 
is the time for team members to voice any concerns with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers.

* At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal review to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog 
items that are now ‘Done’ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. In most cases, the increment is now released.

* The sprint retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, 
or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less 
about what went wrong.

## Benefits of Scrum
* The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects.
* The clear demarcation of roles and planned events ensure that there is transparency and collective ownership throughout the development cycle.
* Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
* Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
* Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, 
low-risk product can be on the market.
* The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be 
delivered as they are needed.
* Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to:
a) Decreased time to market.
b) Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
c) Defects that are fewer and less costly.
d) Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
* Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
* Project focus and goals can change and be adjusted with evolving business goals.

## From the Agile Manifesto
* Individuals and interactions over process tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.
