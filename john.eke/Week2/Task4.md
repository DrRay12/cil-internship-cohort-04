# Story of My Life

## This is a short description of my journey as a Product Manager.

I'm John Eke, a product manager and user experience expert. I started my tech journey as a product designer working on user experience and interfaces for software products but developed an interest in product management because I'm passionate about building the right products for the right people. I want to ensure the products I help build are valuable to users and also drive business impact. Working with amazing teams building great technology is what I live for. My skills include:

* Requirements gathering
* Market research and competitive analysis
* Product vision and strategy
* UI/UX Design
