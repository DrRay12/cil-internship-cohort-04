# Q. Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

## The TCP/IP Model
When something is sent over the internet — a message, a photo, a file — the TCP/IP model divides that data into packets according to a four-layer procedure. 
The data first goes through these layers in one order, and then in reverse order as the data is reassembled on the receiving end.

The TCP/IP model works because the whole process is standardized. Without this, communication will be disorganized and slow things down — and fast internet 
service relies on efficiency. As the global standard, the TCP/IP model is one of the most efficient ways to transfer data over the internet.

TCP and IP are separate computer network protocols. The difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) is their role 
in the data transmission process. IP obtains the address where data is sent. TCP ensures accurate data delivery once that IP address has been found. Together, the 
two form the TCP/IP protocol suite.


## Layers of the TCP/IP Model
There are four layers of the TCP/IP model: network access, internet, transport, and application. Used together, these layers are a suite of protocols. 
The TCP/IP model passes data through these layers in a particular order when a user sends information, and then again in reverse order when the data is received.

## 1) Network Access Layer
The network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that lets computers communicate with one another over the internet. 
This covers ethernet cables, wireless networks, network interface cards, device drivers in the computer, and so on.

The network access layer also includes the technical infrastructure — such as the code that converts digital data into transmittable signals — that makes 
network connection possible.

## 2) Internet Layer
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. 
This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the internet layer may take a little longer 
to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an error corrupting that file.

## 3) Transport Layer
The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices. The transport layer divides the data in packets, acknowledges the 
packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.

## 4) Application Layer
The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. This includes email, messaging apps, and 
cloud storage programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving data.
