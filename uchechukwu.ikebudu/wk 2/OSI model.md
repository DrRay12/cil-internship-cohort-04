# OSI Model
### 1. Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

<p>TCP/IP model
This model doesn't conform to the OSI model since the TCP/IP model is a standard based on the OSI model whilst the OSI model is a functional guidelines &nbsp</p>
<p>Cisco 3 layered structure
he core, the distribution and the access point perfectly fits into the OSI model idea  since both are based on functions &nbsp</p>

* Access layer: comprises of the end users devices like PCs, phones,printers. Web browsers which uses the application layer protocol of the OSI model is found as an app in PCs.
Wired and wireless access points and hubs which are devices found in the physical layer of the OSI model are also found at the access layer of the Cisco layer 
Inside the web browsers you will get the presentation layers which converts human language to machine language and compresses data and encryption of data is ensured when a ssl is used.
Session layers is the app APIs which manages the sessions and does authentication and authorization
* Distribution layer: ensures routing of boundaries, filtering of traffic and Qos(quality of service), segmentation.
Segmentation, flow control are the functions of the transport layer of the OSI and the routers which are also found at this layer is also found at the transport layer of the OSI. LAN addressing are done here which is the network layer of the OSI

* Core layer: ensures connectivity to the internet which falls under the network layer of the OSI
