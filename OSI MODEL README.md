# Question 2 DESCRIBE ANY LAYERED PROCESS YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH SIMILAR TO THE OSI MODEL

In computer science, the concept of network layers is a framework that helps to understand complex network interactions. There are two models that are widely referenced today: OSI and TCP/IP. The concepts are similar, but the layers themselves differ between the two models.

While TCP/IP is the newer model, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is still referenced a lot to describe network layers.

The TCP/IP model is a more concise framework, with only 4 layers:

Network Access (or Link)
Internet
Transport (or Host-to-Host)
Application (or Process)
One mnemonic device for the TCP/IP model is “Armadillos Take In New Ants.”

The TCP/IP model, sometimes referred to as a protocol stack, can be considered a condensed version of the OSI model.

Layer 1 (Network Access): Also called the Link or Network Interface layer. This layer combines the OSI model’s L1 and L2.
Layer 2 (Internet): This layer is similar to the OSI model’s L3.
Layer 3 (Transport): Also called the Host-to-Host layer. This layer is similar to the OSI model’s L4.
Layer 4 (Application): Also called the Process layer, this layer combines the OSI model’s L5, L6, and L7.
