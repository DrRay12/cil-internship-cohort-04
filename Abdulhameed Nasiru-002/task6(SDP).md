# SCRUM
<p>is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components, it is one of the various method in Agile (which is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world, as oppose the traditional, waterfall development approach).</p> 
the steps and component of scrum is follows;

* A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.
* The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
* The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). The  individual/team assess their progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.
* The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.
* At the sprint’s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.
<p>Therefore in a nutshell, instead of large group spending time building a big project, small teams spend's less time building small project, but intergrate regularly to see the whole.</p>

## BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
* FAST: One of the vital benefit of agile methodology (which is a method), is it rapid turn around time.  A faster software development life cycle means less time between paying and getting paid, and more profit for the business
* Values employees. Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules.
* Eliminates rework. By involving the customer at more than just the phases of requirements and delivery, the project remains on-task and in-tune with customer needs at every step. This means less backtracking and less “out on a limb” time between the time we do the work and the time the customer suggests revisions.
* Increased customer satisfaction. Scrum ensures that customers don’t wait for months or years, only to get what they didn’t want. Instead, they get iterations of something very close to what they want, very fast.
### AGILE MANIFESTO: complete the following:
* Individual and interaction over process and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
